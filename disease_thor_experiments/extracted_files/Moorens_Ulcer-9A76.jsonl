#Causes - Moorens Ulcer - 9A76
The cause of Mooren’s ulcer is unknown, but evidence suggests an autoimmune basis. Supportive evidence includes: Presence of plasma cells and lymphocytes in the conjunctiva adjacent to the ulcer. Serum of patients shows circulating antibodies to conjunctival and corneal epithelium. Elevation of serum levels of immunogobulin (Ig) like IgA, IgG and IgM and lymphocytes sensitised to saline- soluble corneal antigen. Increased antibody levels to a cornea- specific stromal protein antigen. Increased helper T cell to suppressor T cell ratio.
#Complications - Moorens Ulcer - 9A76
Complications of Mooren’s ulcer may be: Uveitis, Secondary glaucoma, Cataract, Corneal perforation, End- stage cornea is thinned and conjunctivalised.
#Overview - Moorens Ulcer - 9A76
Mooren’s Ulcer is a painful, progressive, and chronic disease of the cornea, which often is bilateral and may cause severe vision loss or even loss of the eye. It is characterised by painful peripheral corneal ulceration of unknown aetiology. The disease generally begins with intense limbal inflammation and swelling in episclera and conjunctiva. The ulcers are crescent- shaped and may leave behind either an opaque oedematous cornea or is replaced with a thin fibro-vascular membrane. It does not affect underlying Descemet’s membrane. There is no associated scleral inflammation. Intense pain is a hallmark of Mooren’s ulcer, which is generally lacking in other peripheral ulcerative keratitis. The disease may be refractory to all forms of available therapy.
#Diagnosis - Moorens Ulcer - 9A76
Diagnosis of Mooren’s ulcer depends upon medical history, clinical examination and laboratory investigations. Laboratory investigations are required to exclude other systemic diseases. Laboratory investigations include: Blood examination: It includes complete and differential blood cell count including platelet counts and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Serology: It includes measurement of rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibody, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL) test and fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS) test.
#Treatment - Moorens Ulcer - 9A76
The objective and goal of therapy of Mooren’s ulcer is to stop the progression of the ulcerative process and promote re- epithelialisation of the ulcerated area. Medical therapy: Topical corticosteroids: To begin with, patients with Mooren’s ulcer are treated with topical corticosteroids, as long as there is no sign or danger of imminent perforation. Systemic immunosuppressives: Systemic immunosuppressives may be employed in patients with bilateral and progressive disease, and also where conjunctival excision does not result in total healing of ulcer. Interferon- α2b: Recently, an association has been reported between Mooren’s ulcer and hepatitis C infection. Rebetron: Rebetron is a newer treatment option. It combines interferon with the antiviral drug ribavirin. Topical lecithinated superoxide dismutase: A novel experimental therapy with topical lecithinated superoxide dismutase limited tissue destruction in patients who failed to topical corticosteroid therapy. Surgical therapy: Conjunctival resection, Cryotherapy, Keratoplasty, Amniotic membrane transplantation, Keratoepithelioplasty, Conjunctival flap.
#Symptoms - Moorens Ulcer - 9A76
Mooren’s ulcer may produce symptoms such as: Severe ocular pain, Watering, Foreign body sensation, Redness, Photophobia, Blurring of vision.
