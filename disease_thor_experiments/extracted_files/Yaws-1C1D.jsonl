#Causes - Yaws - 1C1D
Yaws is caused by Treponema pertenue which closely resembles to T.pallidium. It is a slender spirochete that is serologically indistinguishable from the spirochete T.pallidium which causes syphilis. The agents found in the epidermis of the lesions, lymph glands, spleen and bone marrow. The organism rapidly dies outside the tissues. Reservoir of infection- Man is the only known reservoir of yaws. Clinical lesions relapse 2-3 times or more during the first 5 years of infections and serve as source for new infections. The most latent cases are found in clusters centered around an infectious case. There are frequent relapses in latent cases. Transmission-Yaws is transmitted through direct (person-to-person), non-sexual contact with the fluid from the lesion of an infected person to an uninfected persons through minor injuries. Most lesions occur on the limbs. The initial lesion of yaws is filled with the bacteria. The incubation period is 9–90 days (average 21 days). About 75% of people affected are children under 15 years old (peak incidence occurs in children aged 6–10 years). Males and females are equally affected. Overcrowding, poor hygiene and poor socioeconomic conditions favours the spread of the yaws
#Overview - Yaws - 1C1D
Yaws. Yaws is a chronic contagious non-venereal disease, belongs to a group of chronic bacterial infections (endemic treponematoses, nonvenereal spirochetal diseases) caused by treponemes. (Other diseases belonging to this group are bejel (endemic syphilis) and pinta). Yaws is the most common of all and occurs primarily in the warm, humid and tropical areas of Africa, Central and South America, the Caribbean, Indian peninsula and the equatorial islands of South-East Asia. Yaws is caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue. Yaws is not a fatal disease, but causes disabilities and visible deformities of the face and extremities contributing to stigma and discrimination. It affects the skin, bone and cartilage; if left untreated it can lead to deformities of the nose and bones of the leg. However, the disease can be cured and prevented by a single dose of antibiotics. In India cases were first reported among tea plantation labourers in Assam in1887. Later on cases occurred in Orissa, Chattishgarh, Madhya Pradesh and other areas.
 #Symptoms - Yaws - 1C1D
There are two basic stages of yaws: early (infectious) and late (non-infectious). In early yaws, an initial papilloma (a circular, solid swelling on the skin, with no visible fluid) develops at the site of entry of the bacterium. This papilloma is full of organisms and may persist for 3–6 months followed by natural healing. Nocturnal bone pain and bone lesions may also occur in the early stage. These primary skin lesions (Early Yaws) usually occur in children and adolescents in endemic areas. Late yaws appears after 5 years of the initial infection and is characterized by disfigurement of the nose and bones, and thickening and cracking of the palms of the hand and soles of the feet. These complications on the soles of the feet make it difficult for patients to walk. Late yaws are non-infectious but may make a person disabled.
#Treatment - Yaws - 1C1D
Two antibiotics are recommended for the treatment of Yaws by WHO. Persons having any features/ symptoms suggestive of Yaws in endemic areas should consult nearest Government Health facility for confirmation and treatment of Yaws. India has eliminated Yaws in September 2006, 3 years after the last case was detected. Now the country is aiming to achieve yaws eradication. The objectives of the Yaws Eradication Programme (YEP) were: (i) Elimination of yaws, defined as zero reporting of cases based on high-quality case searches validated by independent appraisals; (ii) Eradication of yaws, defined as the absence of new cases for a continuous period of 3 years, supported by the absence of evidence of transmission through sero-surveys among children aged 1-5 years.
#Complications - Yaws - 1C1D
About 10% of affected people develop deformities of the legs and nose after 5 years if not received treatment. The disease and its complications lead to school absenteeism and prevent adults from farming activities.
#Diagnosis - Yaws - 1C1D
Yaws simulates the lesions of scabies, impetigo, skin tuberculosis, tinea versicolor, tropical ulcer, leprosy and psoriasis. It may also accompany these diseases. Penicillin treatment is very useful in differential diagnosis because of miraculous relief seen in yaws but not in other skin diseases. Most latent and incubating cases are found in clusters around an infectious case and can usually be diagnosed by epidemiological tracing. Serology- Standard laboratory-based tests- Serological tests are widely used to diagnose treponemal infections (e.g. syphilis and yaws). Serological tests cannot distinguish yaws from syphilis and its interpretation on adults in yaws endemic areas (disease constantly present in a particular region) need careful clinico-epidemiological assessment. Commonly used tests are Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) test and the rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test which are inexpensive, rapid and simple to perform. It takes time for sero-positivity to appear after the onset of disease and hence, initial (mother) case may be sero-negative.
#Prevention - Yaws - 1C1D
Prevention. There is no vaccine for yaws. Prevention is based on the interruption of transmission through early diagnosis and treatment of individual cases and mass or targeted treatment of affected populations or communities. Health education and improvement in personal hygiene are essential components of prevention. Yaws Eradication Programme in India- In 1996, Yaws Eradication Programme (YEP) was launched in India. The programme strategy included: (1) manpower development, (2) case finding (house to house visits by trained para- medical workers), (3) treatment of cases and contacts simultaneously and (4) Information, education and communication (IEC) activities involving multi- sectoral approach (such as inter- sectoral coordination and collaboration between the health and other departments like tribal development deptt., Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS), panchayati raj, forest department and education department were involved in the YEP). 51 districts from 10 states from where yaws cases were reported were included in the programme.
