#Diagnosis - Monkeypox - 1E71
Monkeypox must be clinically differentiated from other rash illnesses, such as chickenpox, measles, bacterial skin infections, scabies, syphilis, herpes simplex virus, molluscum contagiosum virus, enterovirus, parapoxviruses (causing orf and related conditions), chancroid and medication associated allergies. Lymphadenopathy (swollen lymph nodes) during the prodromal stage of monkeypox can distinguish it from chickenpox or smallpox. Any individual that meets the suspected case definition for monkeypox should be tested. Detection of viral DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the preferred laboratory test for monkeypox. A recent or remote vaccination with a vaccinia-based vaccine (e.g. anyone vaccinated before smallpox eradication, or more recently vaccinated due to higher risk such as orthopoxvirus laboratory personnel) may show false-positive results.
#Complication - Monkeypox - 1E71
Complications from severe cases of monkeypox include skin infections, bronchopneumonia, sepsis, encephalitis and eye infections which can lead to loss of vision. In recent times around 3–6% of reported cases have led to death in endemic countries. Newborns, children, pregnant women and people with underlying immune deficiencies may be at risk of serious disease and death from monkeypox.
#Overview - Monkeypox - 1E71
Monkeypox is a viral zoonotic disease (it can spread from animals to humans) with symptoms very similar to those seen previously in smallpox patients, although the illness is less severe. Monkeypox has appeared as the most important orthopoxvirus infection for public health, after the eradication of smallpox in 1980 and the subsequent cessation of smallpox vaccination. The disease is called monkeypox because it was first identified in colonies of monkeys kept for research in a Danish laboratory in 1958.
#Prevention - Monkeypox - 1E71
Reducing the risk of zoonotic transmission: The risk of catching monkeypox from animals can be reduced by avoiding unprotected contact with wild animals, especially those that are sick or dead (including their meat and blood). In endemic countries where animals carry monkeypox, any foods containing animal meat or parts should be cooked thoroughly before eating. Animal trade should be restricted. Reducing the risk for the human to human transmission: Reduce your risk by limiting contact with people who have suspected or confirmed monkeypox. Encourage the infected person to self-isolate and cover any skin lesion if they can (by wearing clothing over the rash). Both patient and caregiver should wear a medical mask, especially if patients are coughing or have lesions in their mouth. Wash the person’s clothes, towels and bedsheets and eating utensils with warm water and detergent. Clean and disinfect any contaminated surfaces and dispose of contaminated waste (e.g., dressings) appropriately.
#Symptoms - Monkeypox - 1E71
The clinical presentation of monkeypox resembles that of smallpox which was declared eradicated worldwide in 1980. Monkeypox is less contagious than smallpox and causes less severe illness. The infection can be divided into two periods. The febrile stage of illness usually lasts 1 to 3 days with symptoms including fever, intense headache, lymphadenopathy (swelling of the lymph nodes), back pain, myalgia (muscle ache), and an intense asthenia (lack of energy). The febrile stage is followed by the skin eruption stage, which lasts for 2 to 4 weeks. Lesions start from macules (lesions with a flat base) to papules (raised firm painful lesions) to vesicles (filled with clear fluid) to pustules (filled with pus), followed by scabs or crusts which dry up and fall off.
#Treatment - Monkeypox - 1E71
Symptoms of Monkeypox often resolve on their own without any specific treatment. Clinical care for monkeypox mainly consists of measures to reduce symptoms, manage complications and prevent long-term sequelae. Patients should be offered fluids and food to maintain adequate nutritional status, Vaccinia immune globulin (VIG) may be recommended for severe cases. An antiviral agent that was developed to treat smallpox -tecovirimat was also approved for the treatment of monkeypox in January 2022. The Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has issued ‘Guidelines on Management of Monkeypox Disease.
#Causes - Monkeypox - 1E71
Monkeypox disease is caused by the monkeypox virus. Monkeypox virus belongs to the Orthopoxvirus genus in the family Poxviridae. The Orthopoxvirus genus also includes variola virus (which causes smallpox), vaccinia virus (used in the smallpox vaccine), and cowpox virus). Monkeypox virus is an enveloped double-stranded DNA virus. There are two distinct genetic clades of the monkeypox virus: the central African (Congo Basin) clade and the West African clade. The natural host of the monkeypox virus: Various animal species are susceptible to the monkeypox virus. Animal hosts include rodents and primates such as rope squirrels, tree squirrels, Gambian pouched rats, dormice, non-human primates and other species.
