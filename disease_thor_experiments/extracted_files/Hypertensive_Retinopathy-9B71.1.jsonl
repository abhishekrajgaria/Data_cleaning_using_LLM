#Causes - Hypertensive Retinopathy - 9B71.1
Chronic hypertension leads to arteriosclerotic changes in the blood vessels. Hypertension may be primary or essential for which there is no detectable cause. Secondary hypertension may be caused by an underlying disease such as: Primary hyperaldosteronism. Cushing’s syndrome. Phaeochromocytoma. -       Renal vascular or renal parenchymal disease. Coarctation of aorta. Hyperthyroidism. Hyperparathyroidism.
#Diagnosis - Hypertensive Retinopathy - 9B71.1
Diagnosis of hypertensive retinopathy is based on presence of systemic hypertension and examination of retina (by an eye specialist) after dilating the pupil. Retinal or Fundus examination: It may show: Narrowing of blood vessels (vasoconstriction): Blood vessels may show generalised or localised narrowing. Severe hypertension may lead to obstruction of arterioles and formation of cotton-wool spots. Leakage: Abnormal vascular permeability leads to retinal oedema, flame-shaped haemorrhages and formation of hard exudates. Hard exudates may be arranged as macular star around the fovea. There may be swelling of the optic nerve head as disc oedema in malignant hypertension. Systemic hypertension may show other ocular manifestations such as: Retinal artery occlusion. Branch retinal vein occlusion. Retinal arterial macroaneurysm. Ischaemic choroidal infarcts (Elschnig’s spots). Ischaemic optic neuropathy. Fluorescein angiography test: Acute malignant hypertension on fluorescein angiography shows non-perfusion of retinal capillaries, microaneurysms and dendritic pattern of choroidal filling in early phase. There is diffuse leakage in late phase.
#Symptoms - Hypertensive Retinopathy - 9B71.1
Most of the patients do not show any symptoms. Patients with malignant hypertension may present with headache, pain in the eye or reduced vision. Involutional sclerosis as such does not produce any symptoms. However, complications of sclerosis like macro-aneurysms or vascular occlusions may produce symptoms.
#Overview - Hypertensive Retinopathy - 9B71.1
Hypertension or raised blood pressure is usually considered when the reading exceeds 140mm of Hg (systolic) and 90mm of Hg (diastolic). It is recorded as 140/90mm of Hg. Treatment at this level depends upon risk of coronary events, presence of diabetes or end organ damage. All patients with malignant hypertension or a sustained blood pressure more than 160/100mm of Hg should be treated. Malignant hypertension refers to severe hypertension ( more than 200mm of Hg as systolic and more than 130mm of Hg as diastolic) in conjunction with bilateral retinal haemorrhages and exudates with or without papilloedema.
#Treatment - Hypertensive Retinopathy - 9B71.1
Systemic hypertension should be controlled as a primary measure for Hypertensive retinopathy. Change in lifestyle with reduction of general risk factors (salt restriction, avoidance of tobacco) help in controlling hypertension. Drugs may be used from groups like: Diuretics. Beta blockers. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Calcium channel blockers. Angiotensin receptor antagonists.
