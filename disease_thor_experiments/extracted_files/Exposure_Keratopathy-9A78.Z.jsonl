#Diagnosis - Exposure Keratopathy - 9A78.Z
Diagnosis depends upon clinical history and evaluation. Clinical history: To determine the aetiology, history should elucidate any recent trauma, surgery, or any infection. Clinical examination: The position of eyelids in a relaxed open and closed position as well as inter-palpebral distance should be assessed. Appositional closure of the eyelids with each blink should be recorded. A complete neurological examination is also conducted including assessment of cranial nerves.
#Causes - Exposure Keratopathy - 9A78.Z
Exposure keratopathy has numerous causes such as: Neurotrophic: Fifth intracranial nerve palsy. Cerebro-vascular accident. Aneurysm. Tumours. Herpes simplex. Herpes zoster. Multiple sclerosis. Neuroparalytic: Intracranial seventh nerve palsy. Malposition of lids: Lagophthalmos. Proptosis.
#Overview - Exposure Keratopathy - 9A78.Z
Exposure keratopathy refers to that surface disorder of the eye in which absence of an adequate tear film results in breakdown of the corneal epithelium. This may produce disruption of corneal epithelium, ulcer formation, superadded infection, thinning and even perforation of eyes in severe cases. Exposure keratopathy is broadly divided into two main categories viz: Exposure due to primary or secondary corneal anaesthesia or hypoaesthesia, Exposure produced by mechanical eyelid abnormalities such as lagophthalmos.
#Symptoms - Exposure Keratopathy - 9A78.Z
Exposure keratopathy may produce symptoms such as: Irritation of eyes. Foreign body sensation. Burning. Blurring of vision. Watering. Redness. Photophobia (increased sensitivity to light). Corneal vascularisation. Corneal ulceration.
#Treatment - Exposure Keratopathy - 9A78.Z
Treatment of exposure keratopathy depends upon underlying aetiology i.e. whether the disease is primarily related to corneal anaesthesia or lagophthalmos. Corneal anaesthesia: In these cases, the mainstay of treatment is lubrication with: Preservative-free artificial tears. Eye ointment at night. Other treatment includes: Bandage contact lenses. Anti-inflammatory agents. Tetracyclines. Autologous serum. Punctal occlusion. Tarsorrhaphy. Amniotic membrane transplantation. Cyanoacrylate glue. Lamellar/penetrating keratoplasty. Lagophthalmos: Mild epitheliopathy: The following treatment is given if there is no ulceration and only mild epitheliopathy is present. It includes: Preservative-free artificial tears. Lubricating ointment at night.
