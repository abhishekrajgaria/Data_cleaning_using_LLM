#Diagnosis - Epicanthus - LD21.Y
Diagnosis is clinical and depends on the origin and configuration of the free fold. Epicanthus supraciliaris: It occurs when the free fold originates from the midpoint of the eyebrow and runs down on the side of nostril, ending over the anterior lacrimal crest. Epicanthus palpebralis: It is similar to epicanthus supraciliaris, except for the fact that the fold originates lower in the tarsal region of the upper eyelid, and runs down over the medial canthal region, ending at the region of the anterior lacrimal crest. Epicanthus tarsalis: This occurs normally in Asians, with the epicanthal fold running along the length of the upper eyelid, obscuring the roots of the eyelashes, and ending with a curl in the medial canthus. Epicanthus inversus: It is a distinct and occurs when the fold arises in the lower eyelid at the midpupillary area and runs upward, obscuring the medial canthal angle and ending in the upper eyelid, which may or may not be affected.
#Causes - Epicanthus - LD21.Y
Epicanthus mainly results from a relative deficiency of skin in the vertical axis (as opposed to the horizontal axis) within the medial canthal area. It may occur alone or in association with other abnormalities such as: Telecanthus. Ptosis of eyelids. Avulsion of medial canthus following trauma. As a part of congenital syndrome e.g. Down’s syndrome.
#Symptoms - Epicanthus - LD21.Y
Parents usually bring the child with features such as: Cosmetic appearance due to epicanthal fold. Suspected strabismus or squint (pseudoesotropia). Obscuration of visual axis especially when eye is turned medially. Associated ptosis (drooping of eyelids).
#Overview - Epicanthus - LD21.Y
Epicanthus or epicanthal fold is a semi-lunar fold of skin at medial canthus, with its concavity facing outward. The epicanthal fold obscures the view of the medial canthus including caruncle and plica semilunaris. Depending on the origin and configuration of free fold, there are at least four distinct types of epicanthus such as: Epicanthus supraciliaris. Epicanthus palpebralis. Epicanthus tarsalis. Epicanthus inversus. Epicanthus generally disappears by the age of puberty as the nasal bridge grows. Epicanthus inversus is usually seen in association with blepharophimosis and may be associated with relative shortage of skin in lateral periorbital area.
#Treatment - Epicanthus - LD21.Y
Treatment should be carried out under medical supervision. Surgical therapy: Rarely is surgery recommended for simple epicanthus since it normally resolves spontaneously as the nasal bridge and mid-face develops. The surgical procedures are: Spaeth’s inverted ‘V’ operation: This procedure may be used for mild degrees of epicanthus, since it is simple and effective. Roveda’s procedure: Roveda’s five flap technique gives excellent results in patients with broad epicanthal folds. Verwey’s ‘Y-V’ operation: This procedure is helpful in patients with moderate epicanthus. Mustardé double Z-plasty: This procedure is adopted for the most complex cases since it is the least satisfactory technique for correction of epicanthus. Pang’s eyelid crease procedure: This is an eyelid crease procedure used to produce full-thickness fibrous tracts in the lids. Prognosis: Majority of children of Asian ancestry lose their folds during and after puberty.
