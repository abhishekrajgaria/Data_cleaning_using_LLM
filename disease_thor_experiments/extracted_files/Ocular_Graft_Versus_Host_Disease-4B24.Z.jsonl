#Causes - Ocular Graft Versus Host Disease - 4B24.Z
Conjunctivitis is commonly observed as a localised ocular reaction in GVHD. Although the mechanism is not understood, flow cytometry has demonstrated the proliferation of T cells in subconjunctival immunogenic inflammation. Histopathology has revealed lymphocyte exocytosis and satellitosis, dyskeratotic cells, epithelial cell necrosis, sub-epithelial micro-vesicle formation and eventually, total separation of the epithelium in the conjunctiva of patients with GVHD. Epithelial attenuation and goblet cell depletion have also been reported.
#Complications - Ocular Graft Versus Host Disease - 4B24.Z
Untreated GVHD may produce complications and sequlae like: Conjunctival scarring, Cicatricial scarring of the lacrimal gland, Corneal thinning or epithelial breakdown, Corneal vascularisation, Corneal infection, Corneal ulceration, Corneal perforation.
#Diagnosis - Ocular Graft Versus Host Disease - 4B24.Z
Ocular GVHD may have clinical manifestations similar to those of autoimmune and collagen vascular diseases affecting the eye, but ocular GVHD does not typically affect the posterior chamber (extremely rare). Clinical tests: Schirmer test: Schirmer test assists in diagnosis of lacrimal function in chronic ocular GVHD. Ocular surface disease index (OSDI): Ocular surface disease index (OSDI) is shown to be statistically higher in patients with chronic ocular GVHD than in pre-transplant or post-transplant patients without ocular GVHD. Videokeratoscope: Videokeratoscope may be used in the evaluation of patients with higher aberrations in patients of chronic GVHD. The diagnostic criteria for ocular GVHD were established by the National institutes of Health Consensus Development Project on Criteria for Clinical Trials in Chronic GVHD in 2005. The Diagnosis and Staging Working Group has stated that a mean Schirmer value of 5mm at 5 minutes or new onset of keratoconjunctivitis sicca by slit lamp examination, with a mean Schirmer value of 6- 10mm, is sufficient for the diagnosis of Chronic GVHD, if accompanied by involvement of at least one other organ system.
#Overview - Ocular Graft Versus Host Disease - 4B24.Z
Ocular graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a complication of allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), where an immunologic response by donor cells against host tissues occurs due to incompatibility between the recipient and donor cells. Haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a common treatment for haematologic, immunologic, metabolic and neoplastic diseases. HSCT is limited due to GVHD, which is a major cause of morbidity following allogeneic HSCT.
#Prevention - Ocular Graft Versus Host Disease - 4B24.Z
Prevention of disease plays an important role in decreasing the morbidity associated with ocular GVHD. Environmental modifications: Environmental modifications and decreased exposure to low-humidity settings may reduce DES symptoms. Ultraviolet light exposure: Minimising ultraviolet light exposure also helps. Eye evaluation: Regular eye evaluation may monitor for the development of infection, cataract, and intraocular pressure elevation. Topical cyclosporine: Prophylactic use of topical cyclosporine (0.05%) might also reduce severity of disease.
#Treatment - Ocular Graft Versus Host Disease - 4B24.Z
A multidisciplinary approach that incorporates collaboration with other medical teams is essential for GVHD patients. This includes collaboration with the haematology and oncology services and stem cell transplantation services. Systemic medical therapy: Immunosuppression: Systemic immunosuppressive medications may be effective in preventing manifestations of GVHD, but this benefit must also be weighed against the associated risks of infection, hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, hypertension, and even death. Local medical therapy: Lubrication and Reduction of Tear evaporation: Preservative-free artificial tears, Punctal occlusion, Moisture chamber goggles. Minimising ocular surface inflammation and immunosuppression: Topical corticosteroids, Topical cyclosporine A. Autologous serum eye drops. Scleral contact lenses. Mucolytic agents.  Surgical therapy: Tarsorrhaphy, Amniotic membrane grafting, Cyanoacrylate glue patching, Deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK), Penetrating keratoplasty (PK).
#Symptoms - Ocular Graft Versus Host Disease - 4B24.Z
Ocular (eye) manifestations vary widely. Patient may present with ocular symptoms of: Dryness, Irritation, Photophobia, Blurred vision, Redness, Mucoid discharge, Conjunctival edema or chemises, Pseudo-membrane formation, Corneal infections, Corneal ulceration, Corneal perforation, Potentially permanent loss of vision.
#Risk factors - Ocular Graft Versus Host Disease - 4B24.Z
Established risk factors associated with the development of GVHD which affect the severity of clinical presentation are: Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) mismatch between donor and the recipient. Gender disparity e.g. male donor for female recipient and vice versa. Source of the stem cells. Type of prophylaxis or conditioning regimen undertaken. Advanced donor and recipient age. History of acute GVHD (in cases of chronic GVHD).
