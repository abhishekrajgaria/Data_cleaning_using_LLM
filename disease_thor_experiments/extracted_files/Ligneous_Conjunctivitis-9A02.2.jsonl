#Complications - Ligneous Conjunctivitis - 9A02.2
Ligneous conjunctivitis may lead to complications like: Recurrence of disease on withdrawal of the topical medicine, Recurrence of disease after surgical excision, Neovascularisation of cornea, Scarring of cornea, Corneal perforation, Corneal infections, Loss of vision, Amblyopia in children.
#Causes - Ligneous Conjunctivitis - 9A02.2
There is evidence to support that ligneous conjunctivitis is the result of plasminogen deficiency. There are two types of plasminogen deficiency: Type I (hypo-plasminogenaemia) is a quantitative deficiency. Type II (dys-plasminogenaemia) is a qualitative deficiency. Type I deficiency is the type most associated with LC. With plasminogen deficiency, wound-healing capability is diminished and is most pronounced in mucous membranes, such as the conjunctiva. The impaired wound healing capacity causes an arrest of granulation tissue formation and excessive fibrin deposition. Due to the appearance, histopathology, clinical course, and response to treatment, it is also believed that LC results from an exaggerated inflammatory response to tissue injury. This injury may arise from infection or physical trauma, including surgery. Many cases of antecedent viral or bacterial infections have been described, including staphylococcal, streptococcal, and haemophilus conjunctivitis. In these cases, it appears that LC, in genetically susceptible individuals, develops as an abnormal response to the conjunctival trauma elicited by the infecting organisms. Trauma, especially from surgery, is also thought to be a cause of LC. LC appears to develop as an abnormal response of the immune system to the conjunctival trauma.
#Diagnosis - Ligneous Conjunctivitis - 9A02.2
The diagnosis of LC is based on the clinical picture (ocular and/or extra-ocular membranous lesions), the typical histological findings, and a possible positive family history. In most patients with LC, hypo-plasminogenaemia may be found. If the responsible mutation has been identified in an affected family, then prenatal diagnosis of children at risk is possible. Laboratory diagnosis: Abnormality of plasminogen activity and/or antigen: Laboratory analysis confirms disorder with an abnormality of plasminogen activity and/or antigen. Prenatal testing: Prenatal testing to identify genetic mutations may be conducted to identify this disease. Histopathological/ Immuno-histochemical evaluation: Histological examination of ligneous membranes shows superficial or sub-epithelial deposits of eosinophilic amorphous hyaline, amyloid-like material with a variable proportion of granulation tissue with accompanying inflammatory cells (lymphocytes, plasma cells and granulocytes).
#Overview - Ligneous Conjunctivitis - 9A02.2
Ligneous conjunctivitis (LC) is a rare, potentially sight and even life-threatening (e.g. by airway obstruction) disorder characterised by recurrent, often bilateral fibrin-rich pseudo-membranous lesions of wood-like consistency that develop mainly on the tarsal conjunctiva. It is the main clinical manifestation of systemic plasminogen deficiency and typically presents in childhood. There appears to be a higher incidence in females as compared to males. With plasminogen deficiency, wound-healing capability is diminished and is most pronounced in mucous membranes, such as conjunctiva.  Plasminogen is converted to plasmin by plasminogen activators in the blood. Plasmin is a serine protease and is the predominant fibrinolytic enzyme in the human circulation, and is also found in the extracellular matrix. Plasmin plays an important role in haemostasis, as well as, is an integral component of wound healing (acts by degrading fibrin). Due to plasminogen deficiency, fibrin rich membranes or mucous strands accumulate, which on desiccation of the fibrin leads to the ligneous consistency of the conjunctival lesions. Episodes may be triggered by relatively minor trauma, surgery (done particularly for pterygium or pinguecula) or by systemic events such as fever and anti-fibrinolytic therapy. Similar mechanisms occur in extra-ocular manifestations of plasminogen deficiency.
#Symptoms - Ligneous Conjunctivitis - 9A02.2
Patients typically present with chronic conjunctivitis and LC is bilateral in about half of the cases. Duration of disease varies from few months to many years. According to the severity, ocular (eye) symptoms may be: Early cases show: Redness, Chronic watering, Mild discomfort, Pain, Photophobia (sensitivity to light), White or red masses on conjunctiva. Severe cases may have: Constant discomfort which affect daily activities, Lesions may extend beyond the lid margin, Membranes.
#Prevention - Ligneous Conjunctivitis - 9A02.2
There is no primary preventive measure for this disease as it is often inherited.
#Treatment - Ligneous Conjunctivitis - 9A02.2
Management should be carried out under medical supervision. Management of LC tends to be unsatisfactory and spontaneous resolution is rare. It is important to discontinue any anti-fibrinolytic therapy. Medical therapy: Plasminogen substitution: Systemic and topical plasminogen substitution or Fresh Frogen Plasma (FFP) is presently being investigated as the primary treatment for ligneous conjunctivitis. Cyclosporine A: Cyclosporine A had been the most promising element in the therapeutic management before plasminogen. Topical therapy including, topical hyaluronidase, heparin, azathioprine, alpha-chymotrypsin, sodium cromoglycate, antibiotics, corticosteroids, and fibrinolysin have shown limited success. Surgical therapy: Because trauma to the conjunctiva is likely to be an aetiological factor in LC, conjunctival surgery must be performed with utmost care. Amniotic membrane transplantation: Barbino and Rolando performed amniotic membrane transplantation for conjunctival reconstruction of LC. Prognosis: The prognosis for ligneous conjunctivitis is variable and is based upon the extent, length and the affected site producing symptoms. It depends on the ability to control inflammation and recurrence of pseudo-membranes. Patients with corneal involvement have poorer visual prognosis.
