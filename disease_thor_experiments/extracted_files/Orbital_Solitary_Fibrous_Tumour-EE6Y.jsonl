#Causes - Orbital Solitary Fibrous Tumour - EE6Y
Orbital solitary fibrous tumour is an uncommon benign spindle cell tumour with ultra structural and immuno-histochemical characteristics of mesenchymal fibroblast like cells. SFTs are presumed to arise from pluripotent mesenchymal stem cells that have the capacity to differentiate along endothelial, pericytic, or fibroblastic phenotypes, similar to normal angiogenesis. This may explain the presence of the characteristic haemangiopericytoma like vessels. Currently, there is no stain to identify specific lineage such as pericytic origin.
#Diagnosis - Orbital Solitary Fibrous Tumour - EE6Y
Histopathology: Histopathologically, morphology of SFTs varies from highly cellular vascular lesion to fibrous areas with less number of cells. Fibrous matrix contains broad bands of collagen. Imaging studies: CT Orbit: CT orbit shows mild to moderately enhanced well circumscribed mass with or without remodelling of adjacent bone. MRI: MRI shows intermediate intensity mass on T1-weighted images with moderate enhancement after gadolium. Ultrasonography: On ultrasonography, tumours show low reflectivity with moderate attenuation.
#Overview - Orbital Solitary Fibrous Tumour - EE6Y
Orbital Solitary Fibrous Tumour (SFT) is an uncommon benign spindle cell tumour with characteristics of mesenchymal fibroblast- like cells. It was originally recognised in the pleura. It is also seen in peritoneum, mediastinum, deep soft tissues of extremities, and conjunctiva as well. Orbital solitary fibrous tumour in orbit may involve intraconal or extraconal compartment, lacrimal sac, lacrimal gland fossa, and eyelids. It is possible that orbital SFTs were under diagnosed earlier because of its rarity in extra-pleural sites and histological similarity to other spindle-cell tumours.
#Symptoms - Orbital Solitary Fibrous Tumour - EE6Y
SFT most commonly presents in middle-aged patients with symptoms such as Gradual unilateral progressive proptosis. Mass effect as non pulsatile tumour (predominantly in the superior part of orbit). Diminution of vision. Restriction of ocular movements. Blepharoptosis. It is usually not associated with features of pain or entrapment of nerves. Recurrent tumours often invade surrounding soft tissue or bone, with possibility of spread into nasal sinuses or cranial cavities.
#Treatment - Orbital Solitary Fibrous Tumour - EE6Y
Complete surgical resection is the treatment of choice. Incomplete removal increases the risk of clinical recurrence of tumour. Therefore, close follow up is required in cases with suspected residual tumour. Adjunctive radiation therapy is used in highly cellular lesions. Recurrent tumours may show features of malignancy and may metastasise.
