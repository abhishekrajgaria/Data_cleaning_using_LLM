#Causes - Trochlear Nerve Palsy - 9C81.1
The Causes of trochlear nerve palsy may be: Congenital. Closed head trauma. Intracranial space occupying lesions. Aneurysm of internal carotid artery in its intra-cavernous course. Decompensation of asymptomatic congenital palsy because of monocular visual deprivation. Idiopathic. Presumed microvascular (diabetes mellitus or hypertension). There is no direct evidence of ischaemia. Virtually all microvascular cases resolve even without treatment.
#Diagnosis - Trochlear Nerve Palsy - 9C81.1
Diagnosis depends upon the clinical features and the clinical tests. Tests: Cover-uncover test: Cover-uncover test demonstrate hypertropia which worsens in contralateral gaze. Maddox rod test: Like Cover-uncover test, Maddox rod test also demonstrate hypertropia, which worsens in contralateral gaze. Imaging: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI): MRI may identify lesions affecting brain parenchyma or brainstem. It may identify lesions like brain tumour or ischaemia. CT scanning: CT scanning may detect presence of any calcification or aneurysm.
#Overview - Trochlear Nerve Palsy - 9C81.1
Trochlear Nerve Palsy (Fourth Cranial Nerve Palsy) manifests as an isolated vertical, diagonal, or cyclo-torsional diplopia (double vision). It is worse on looking down and to the side opposite the lesion. In addition to the defect in eye movement, the affected eye produces characteristic head tilt away from the affected side. Fourth cranial nerve palsies are relatively uncommon. Isolated fourth cranial nerve palsy is the most common cause producing vertical diplopia. Trauma is the usual trigger of trochlear nerve palsy.
#Symptoms - Trochlear Nerve Palsy - 9C81.1
Patients with isolated trochlear nerve palsy may be asymptomatic. Symptoms include: Slight elevation of the eye with the paralysed muscle in the primary position of gaze. Vertical and torsional (intorsion) diplopia, which is worse in inferior gaze. Head tilt on the opposite shoulder (to minimise diplopia). Inability to depress either eye fully in adduction (in bilateral trochlear nerve palsies).
#Treatment - Trochlear Nerve Palsy - 9C81.1
Medical therapy: Prisms: Prisms may be tried in patients with small deviation and in diplopia without any torsional component. Botulinum toxin: Results of Botulinum toxin as a primary therapy are discouraging. However, it may be used to correct residual deviation after strabismus surgery to delay or avoid further surgery. Surgical therapy: Patients with bilateral superior oblique palsy, especially with large ex-cyclotorsion, may undergo surgery for both superior oblique muscles. Prognosis: Prognosis of Trochlear Nerve palsy depends upon the underlying aetiology.
