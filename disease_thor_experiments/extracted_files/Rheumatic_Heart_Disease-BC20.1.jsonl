#Causes - Rheumatic Heart Disease - BC20.1
Rheumatic fever is caused by the immune system overreacting to the presence of group A streptococcus bacteria. During infection the immune system fights the infection by producing antibodies to proteins on the surface of the bacteria. Streptococcus pyogenes causes a wide variety of diseases in humans. It is one of the most common causes of acute bacterial pharyngitis that leads to RF/RHD. Impetigo, a common skin infection, is also caused by S. pyogenes and is associated with acute glomerulonephritis (AGN). In rare cases, S. pyogenes causes invasive diseases such as cellulitis, bacteremia, necrotizing fasciitis, and toxic shock syndrome (TSS).
#Overview - Rheumatic Heart Disease - BC20.1
Rheumatic fever (RF) and rheumatic heart disease (RHD) are major public health problems among children and young adults in developing countries; though RF/RHD has declined in developed countries. Acute rheumatic fever (ARF) is an illness caused by an immunological reaction to infection with the bacterium group A streptococcus (GAS). RF affects connective tissues, and may result in rheumatic heart disease which may progress to heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and embolic stroke.
#Prevention - Rheumatic Heart Disease - BC20.1
Primordial Prevention- A consolidated effort is necessary to improve the socio-economic condition of the poorer strata in society, particularly to ensure proper housing to reduce overcrowding and malnutrition. Health education programme should generate awareness regarding maintenance of both personal and environmental hygiene and about all the factors that predispose to GAS infection. Primary Prevention is the treatment of acute streptococcal pharyngitis in order to prevent the initial attack of rheumatic fever. Health personnel also need to be trained regarding early diagnosis and effective treatment of streptococcal pharyngitis. Secondary Prevention- According to WHO, for all individuals who have had an initial attack of rheumatic fever, whether or not they have rheumatic heart disease, continuous administration of an antibiotic is mandatory to prevent infection of the upper respiratory tract by group A streptococci. Tertiary Prevention is directed towards prevention of disability and premature death by surgical or medical management of heart failure and valve surgery, i.e., balloon mitral valvuloplasty or surgical mitral commissurotomy or valve replacement.
#Treatment - Rheumatic Heart Disease - BC20.1
Treatment of Acute rheumatic fever (ARF) is based on treating infection and relieving symptoms. This includes: antibiotics to treat the streptococcal infection, medication to reduce arthritis and fever, rest, and a healthy diet. For patients for whom the regular and repeated injections of benzathine benzylpenicillin are not given, daily oral phenoxymethylpenicillin may be used. An oral sulfonamide is recommended for secondary prophylaxis to patients known to be allergic to penicillin. For individuals who cannot take either penicillin or sulfadiazine, erythromycin may be used.
#Complication - Rheumatic Heart Disease - BC20.1
Chronic rheumatic heart disease- The main complication of rheumatic fever is rheumatic heart disease. It's estimated that around one in three people with a history of rheumatic fever will go on to develop rheumatic heart disease. Atrial fibrillation-In some cases, rheumatic heart disease can lead to atrial fibrillation a heart condition that causes an irregular and often abnormally fast heart rate and can lead to increased risk of stroke. Heart failure- In more severe cases of RHD, the heart damaged so much that it can’t pump enough blood to the body. Pregnancy and RHD- RHD is the commonest heart disease associated with pregnancy. It is found in about 1% of pregnant women which leads to significant maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality.
#Diagnosis - Rheumatic Heart Disease - BC20.1
There is currently no single test to diagnose acute rheumatic fever (ARF). Diagnosis is based on clinical assessment and the identification of a number of signs and symptoms that are associated with the illness. Signs and symptoms of ARF are divided into two categories: major and minor.  Minor signs and symptoms are used to help support the diagnosis. These include fever, arthralgia (generalised joint aches), blood tests that suggest general illness (elevated ESR), and changes seen on electrocardiogram (Increased P-R interval). Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) is most accurately diagnosed using ultrasound. Ultrasound of the heart is referred to as echocardiography.
#Symptoms - Rheumatic Heart Disease - BC20.1
Acute rheumatic fever (ARF) is preceded by sore throat. Sore throats are caused by a variety of bacteria and viruses and commonly affect all age groups; however, important symptoms and signs of Streptococcus sore throat are: High Temperature, Tender cervical lymph nodes, Redness of pharynx, Pus like exudates on pharynx & throat, Bleeding spots in the throat, Pain while swallowing. In RF typically, the child may complain of fever, accompanied by following symptoms: Arthritis- Pain and swelling of joints is the common symptom of the ARF, occurring in up to 75% of patients in the first attack of RF. Carditis (inflammation of heart): Symptoms may be seen in the form of shortness of breath, persistent cough, rapid heartbeat (tachycardia), chest pain, and feeling of tiredness all the time. Subcutaneous nodules: Round, firm, freely movable, painless nodules varying in size from 0.5–2.0cm are found over bony prominences or extensor tendons. Skin rash: The rash is painless, non-itchy and subsides usually within few weeks or months.
