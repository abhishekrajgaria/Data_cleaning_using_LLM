#Causes - Terriens Marginal Degeneration - H18.469
The cause of Terrien’s marginal degeneration remains unknown. There are two types: Classic form: The classic form most commonly affects patients older than 40 years of age without rheumatoid arthritis and progression is extremely slow. Inflammatory type: Inflammatory variant of Terrien’s marginal degeneration affects younger subjects and it is characterised by recurrent and disabling attacks of acute pain and inflammation.
#Overview - Terriens Marginal Degeneration - H18.469
Terrien’s Marginal Degeneration (TMD) is a slowly progressive, bilateral, peripheral corneal thinning disorder associated with corneal neovascularisation, opacification and lipid deposition. The disease is usually bilateral but may initially present in one eye. The cause of Terrien’s marginal degeneration is not known and patients may have high degrees of astigmatism. Up to about one third of patients may have associated episcleral or scleral inflammation. Patients are typically between 20-40 years of age, although it may present in childhood or in older people (age ranges from 10 to 70 years). It is more common in men than in women.
#Symptoms - Terriens Marginal Degeneration - H18.469
Patients are asymptomatic with initial mild disease. Patient with advanced disease may have symptoms such as: Painless progressive blurred vision. Progressive change of glasses. Less common symptoms may be: Recurrent attacks of ocular irritation. Pseudo-pterygium.
#Complications - Terriens Marginal Degeneration - H18.469
There may be complications like: Corneal hydrops: Corneal hydrops presents as a clear intra-corneal pocket of aqueous rather than stromal clouding. Spontaneous breaks in Descemet’s membrane may occur. With intact overlying Bowman’s layer, it causes formation of intra-lamellar corneal dissection and corneal cysts. Occasionally, intra-corneal aqueous pockets become continuous with subconjunctival space and result in filtering blebs with hypotony. Corneal perforation: Corneal perforation may occur either spontaneously or following minor trauma. Pseudo-pterygium: Pseudo-pterygium in TMD characteristically occurs in positions other than 3 o’clock and 9 o’clock and grows onto the cornea at an oblique angle.
#Diagnosis - Terriens Marginal Degeneration - H18.469
Terrienâ€™s marginal degeneration is distinguished from other peripheral corneal thinning disorders by: Lack of inflammation. Presence of superficial vascularisation. Advancing linear deposition of lipid. Lack of epithelial defect. Slow progressive course. Corneal topography/ Videokeratography: Corneal topography/ Videokeratography measures corneal curvature, elevation and the amount of corneal astigmatism. This also helps in fitting rigid gas permeable contact lenses. Corneal topography reveals flattening over the peripheral areas of corneal thinning. It shows steepening opposite to the mid-point of corneal thinning. Scanning slit topography: Scanning slit topography utilises optical slits that scan along multiple points of the cornea. This allows for measurements of the anterior and posterior cornea including pachymetry (measures corneal thickness). Ultrasound biomicroscopy: Ultrasound biomicroscopy quantifies the thickness of the cornea and help to detect progression of disease. Due to its high magnification and ability to depict the size and shape of structures, it can reveal subtle changes in the cornea.
#Treatment - Terriens Marginal Degeneration - H18.469
Management should be carried out under medical supervision. Usually no treatment is required, unless perforation or impending perforation occurs. However, spectacles and rigid gas permeable lenses are prescribed for refractive errors. Medical therapy: Spectacle correction: To begin with in the early mild cases of the disease, spectacle correction is prescribed. Patients with high astigmatism may be prescribed with high refractive index sphero-cylindrical glasses. Due to the risk of corneal perforation in the area of TMD, polycarbonate lenses are recommended. Polycarbonate lenses are light weight and impact resistant. Rigid gas permeable (RGP) contact lenses: Rigid gas permeable (RGP) contact lenses may be required for cases of TMD. Piggyback rigid gas permeable contact lenses may be used. In piggyback, a soft contact lens is worn under the gas permeable lens, acting as a cushion to reduce or eliminate any discomfort caused by the gas- permeable lens. It is recommended that patients wear plano polycarbonate glasses over their contact lens prescription to avoid any risk of corneal perforation due to thinning. Surgical therapy: Keratoplasty: Keratoplasty is considered for patients with TMD whose vision is inadequate with contact lenses or for patients who are intolerant to lens. Reconstructive keratoplasty is performed when thinning becomes so severe that corneal perforation is threatened or it occurs. Penetrating keratoplasty: In general, patients with TMD are usually poor candidates for penetrating keratoplasty as the corneal thinning occurs close to the limbus. As a result, large eccentric grafts are required and must be positioned very close to the limbus thus increasing the chances of graft rejection or suture-induced complications. Lamellar crescentic keratoplasty: In lamellar crescentic keratoplasty, crescent-shaped donor lamellar (partial thickness) cornea is used. Full- thickness crescentic keratoplasty: In Full- thickness crescentic keratoplasty, thinned cornea is removed entirely and the DescemetÕs membrane of the donor is retained. Annular lamellar keratoplasty: Annular lamellar keratoplasty grafts may be required in severe cases of TerrienÕs marginal degeneration, involving complete 360û. Lamellar keratoplasties are often preferred over penetrating keratoplasty because of the decreased risk of graft rejection, corneal opacification and development of irregular astigmatism.
