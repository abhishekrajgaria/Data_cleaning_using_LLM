#Complications - Keratoconjunctivitis Sicca - 9A79
Complications are usually not there or are minimal in mild to moderate KCS. Severe cases may show : Blepharospasm, Breakdown of epithelial layer covering front of eye, Superficial peripheral vascularisation of cornea, Secondary bacterial infection of cornea, Descemetocele formation, Melting of cornea, Corneal perforation and its sequlae.
#Causes - Keratoconjunctivitis Sicca - 9A79
Aqueous layer deficiency: It can be : Pure KCS : Lacrimal gland alone is affected by fibrosis. Lacrimal gland destruction by dysthyroid ophthalmopathy, sarcoidosis, tumour or pseudotumour. Surgical removal of lacrimal gland. Conjunctival scarring blocking excretory ducts of lacrimal gland or causing destruction of mucin secreting glands. Congenital absence of lacrimal gland. Hyposecretion of tears with increasing age. Vitamin A deficiency. Neurological lesions with sensory or motor reflex loss. Dry eye due to evaporation of tears: It can be: Exposure keratopathy leading to dry cornea e. g. Bell’s palsy. Dry eyes associated with contact lens wear. Environmental factors like exposure to heating, air conditioning, increased velocity of air or reduced humidity.
#Overview - Keratoconjunctivitis Sicca - 9A79
Keratoconjunctivitis Sicca (KCS) or Dry eye syndrome is mainly caused due to aqueous tear deficiency. A defect in any component of tear film may lead to dry eye syndrome but primarily it is from aqueous tear deficiency. Tears have smaller basic (resting) and larger reflex component. Reflex secretion occurs due to corneal sensory stimulation.
#Diagnosis - Keratoconjunctivitis Sicca - 9A79
Dry eye should be distinguished from other diseases affecting anterior surface of the eye e.g. conjunctivitis, infectious diseases, corneal abnormalities or keratopathies. Diagnosis depends upon clinical examination of eyes and conduct of certain specialised tests. Tear film break-up time (BUT) : This is the interval between last blink and the appearance of first dry spot. Rose Bengal test : Rose Bengal dye stains mucus, dead and devitalised cells on cornea, being produced by dry eye. Lissamine green test : Lissamine green dye stains both, healthy cells not covered by mucin as well as devitalised or dead cells. Schirmer’s test : It measures basic and reflex secretion(Schirmer’s test 1). Impression cytology : Impression cytology determines population of mucin secreting goblet cells. Other tests that may be used are: Tear stability analysis system, Tear ferning test, Tear function index.
#Treatment - Keratoconjunctivitis Sicca - 9A79
Aim is to provide symptomatic relief to patient. A smooth corneal surface prevents its further   damage and aggravation of symptoms. Various modalities may be: Avoiding high room temperature to decrease evaporation of existing tears. Use of room humidifiers or moist chamber spectacles to reduce evaporation. Use of systemic immunosuppressants. Conjunctival flap may be pulled over to prevent dryness and its complications. Mucous membrane grafting. Amniotic membrane transplantation may be done. Salivary gland duct transposition for lubrication.
#Symptoms - Keratoconjunctivitis Sicca - 9A79
Many patients do not have any symptoms. Some may have noticed deficient or reduced tears on peeling onions or even being emotional. Common symptoms are: Irritation of eyes, Burning sensations of eyes, Foreign body sensation in eyes, Mucoid discharge, Transient blurring or fluctuation of vision, Excessive tearing (due to reflex secretion in response of dry eye), Hyperemia (redness) of eyes. Less common symptoms may include: Tired feeling or heaviness of eyelids, Photophobia, Itching.
