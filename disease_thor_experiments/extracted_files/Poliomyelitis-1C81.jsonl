#Complications - Poliomyelitis - 1C81
Paralytic polio can lead to temporary or permanent muscle paralysis, disability, and deformities of the hips, ankles and feet. Although many  deformities can be corrected with surgery and physical therapy, these treatments may not be options in developing nations where polio is still endemic. As a result, children who survive polio may spend their lives with severe disabilities. Aspiration. pneumonia. Cor Pulmonale. Lack of movement. Lung Problems. Pulmonary edema. Shock. Permanent muscle paralysis. Urinary tract infection.
#Causes - Poliomyelitis - 1C81
Poliomyelitis is caused by infection with a virus called as poliovirus. It colonizes in the gastrointestinal tract specifically the pharynx and intestine. It is highly contagious and spreads through either fecal-oral route , ingestion of contaminated food and water or oral-oral route.
#Overview - Poliomyelitis - 1C81
The words polio (grey) and myelon (marrow, indicating the spinal cord) are derived from the Greek. It is the effect of poliomyelitis virus on the spinal cord that leads to the classic manifestation of paralysis. Poliomyelitis or poliio is a crippling and potentially deadly infectious disease caused by poliovirus that spreads from person to person invading the brain and spinal cord resulting into paralysis. Humans are the only known reservoir of poliovirus, which is transmitted most frequently by persons having infection.

#Diagnosis - Poliomyelitis - 1C81
Viral Isolation Poliovirus may be recovered from the stool or pharynx of a person with poliomyelitis. Isolation of virus from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is diagnostic, but is rarely accomplished. If poliovirus is isolated from a person with acute flaccid paralysis, it must be tested further, using oligonucleotide mapping (fingerprinting) or genomic sequencing, to determine if the virus is “wild type” (that is, the virus that causes polio disease) or vaccine type (virus that could derive from a vaccine strain). Serology Neutralizing antibodies appear early and may be at high levels by the time the patient is hospitalized; therefore, a four fold rise in antibody titer may not be demonstrated. Cerebrospinal Fluid In polio virus infection, the CSF usually contains an increased number of white blood cells (10–200 cells/mm3, primarily lymphocytes) and a mildly elevated protein (40–50 mg/100 mL).
#Prevention - Poliomyelitis - 1C81
Due to unavailability of any cure till date vaccination is the best way of protection and the only way to control the spread of disease. There are two types of vaccine that protect against polio: Inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) and oral polio vaccine (OPV). IPV, is given as an injection in the leg or arm, depending on patient's age. Polio vaccine may be given at the same time as other vaccines. Most people should get polio vaccine when they are children. Children get 4 doses of IPV, at these ages: 2 months, 4 months, 6-18 months, and booster dose at 4-6 years. OPV consists of a mixture of live, attenuated (weakened) poliovirus strains of all three poliovirus types. Under the pulse polio immunization programme, all children below the age of 5 years are administered two doses of the oral polio vaccine per year. The oral polio vaccine is administered in the program, since it not only protects the child, but also gets disseminated to the community, thus resulting in widespread protection.
#Symptoms - Poliomyelitis - 1C81
Up to 95% of all polio infections are asymptomatic. Infected persons without symptoms shed virus in the stool and are able to transmit virus to other. Approximately 4%–8% of polio infections result into a minor illness without clinical or laboratory evidence of central nervous system invasion. This is known as abortive poliomyelitis, and is characterized by complete recovery in less than a week. Three symptoms observed with this form of poliovirus infection are upper respiratory tract infection (sore throat and fever) ,gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain , constipation or diarrhea ) and influenza-like illness. 1-2% of polio infections leads to Nonparalytic aseptic meningitis (symptoms of stiffness of the neck, back, and/or legs), usually following several days after the above mentioned symptoms similar to that of minor illness. Increased or abnormal sensations can also occur. Typically these symptoms will last from 2 to 10days, followed by complete recovery.
#Treatment - Poliomyelitis - 1C81
Because there is no cure for polio, supportive therapy is given to the patient. Supportive care usually consists of treating the symptoms until the patient recovers. It includes medication for polio symptoms, exercise and a balanced diet.
