#Causes - Perennial Allergic Conjunctivitis - 9A60.02
PAC causes symptoms throughout the year, generally worse in the autumn when exposure to animal dander, house dust mites and fungal allergens is highest. In contrast, Individuals with SAC have symptoms of acute allergic conjunctivitis for a defined period of time, caused by pollens from trees, weeds and grass, although the specific allergen varies in different geographic locations. Persons with SAC are symptom-free in winter/cooler climates because of the decreased airborne transmission of these allergens. Acute allergy is caused by IgE-mediated MC de-granulation, whereas chronic allergies are also associated with continuous activation of MC but with predominance of mediators, such as eosinophils and T- helper2 (Th2) lymphocyte-generated cytokines.
#Diagnosis - Perennial Allergic Conjunctivitis - 9A60.02
Diagnosis of PAC is generally based on clinical history and careful slit-lamp (bio-microscopic) examination by an eye-specialist. Diagnostic procedures: Intra-dermal skin test: Intra-dermal skin test is the standard clinical test for the diagnosis of type I hypersensitivity reaction. Superficial conjunctival scrapings: Superficial conjunctival scrapings in more active cases may help to establish the diagnosis by revealing characteristic eosinophils which are not normally present on the conjunctiva. Radio-allergo-sorbent test (RAST): Radio-allergo-sorbent test (RAST), a blood test, may also help to define the allergens. Conjunctival provocation test: Conjunctival provocation test consist of instilling offending allergen into the conjunctival sac, producing the typical symptoms of PAC. Nasal allergy test: There is also a possible involvement of nasal allergy in some patients with allergic conjunctivitis, such as PAC, and therefore, there may be value to a nasal challenge with allergen combined with registration of ocular features.
#Overview - Perennial Allergic Conjunctivitis - 9A60.02
Perennial allergic conjunctivitis (PAC) is an inflammatory response of the conjunctiva triggered by exposure to allergens such as pollens, animal dander (flecks of dead skin cells and hair/feathers) and other environmental antigens. PAC may not be caused exclusively by seasonal allergens, although they may play a role. Perennial allergic conjunctivitis (PAC) represents a disease under chronic allergic conjunctivitis (CAC), together with seasonal allergic conjunctivitis (SAC), atopic keratoconjunctivitis (AKC), vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) and, to a certain extent, giant papillary conjunctivitis (GPC).
#Prevention - Perennial Allergic Conjunctivitis - 9A60.02
For prevention of PAC, avoidance of the offending allergen is the primary behavioural modification. Specific testing will identify the responsible allergen and help a person to ensure ways to avoid it. Contact reactions caused by medications or cosmetics may be prevented by avoidance. Reduce amount of allergen exposure by: Keeping household clean: Allergens in PAC are usually mould spores, animal dander, dust mites, and are predominantly found in the household. Using air purifiers: Air purifiers that use High-efficiency particulate arrestance or high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtration are more effective and safer (remove up to 99% of the material like dust mite faeces, all allergens, such as animal dander, dust, pollen, or cockroach faeces).
#Treatment - Perennial Allergic Conjunctivitis - 9A60.02
General measures: Keeping household clean, Air purifiers. Supportive measures: Cold compresses, Saline solutions, Artificial tears, Avoidance of eye rubbing. Medical therapy: Topical vasoconstrictors, Topical antihistamine,Combined topical vasoconstrictor and antihistamine, Systemic antihistamines, Topical second-generation H1 antihistamines, Topical mast cell stabilisers, H1 receptor blocker and mast-cell stabiliser (Dual-acting agents), Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs), Topical corticosteroids, Immune-modulators, Allergen-specific immunotherapy. Prognosis: Prognosis of PAC is good despite significant discomfort and undesirable cosmetic appearance.
#Symptoms - Perennial Allergic Conjunctivitis - 9A60.02
Symptoms of PAC and SAC are essentially similar and typically develop on a gradual basis but can also develop suddenly following contact with the offending allergen. Ocular symptoms associated with PAC may be: Ocular itching. Redness of eyes. Watering or tearing (epiphora). Burning. Stinging or pricking sensation. Mucoid discharge. Chemosis (swelling of conjunctiva). Photophobia (sensitivity to light). Eyelid swelling. Dryness of eyes.
