#Causes - Obesity - 5B81.Z
Obesity doesn't occur overnight. It develops gradually over time when there is disturbance in energy balance. The reasons for the imbalance between calorie intake and energy out may vary from individual to individual. Genes may affect the amount of fat storage and distribution of fat in body. Overweight and obesity tend to run in families not just because of genetics but family members tend to share similar eating and activity habits. Diet rich in calories (fast foods), high calorie beverages, oversized portions, bad eating habits (eating between meals, preference to sweets, refined foods, and fats), diet lacking with fruits and vegetables; all these factors contribute to weight gain. With a sedentary lifestyle such as sedentary occupation and inactive recreation (watching television) more calories are stored in the body every day than used through exercise. Certain medicines such as corticosteroids, antidepressants and medicines used for seizure control may cause weight gain. For some people, eating habits are influenced by emotions such as sadness, stress, boredom or anger and they react by eating excessively. Quitting smoking is often associated with weight gain. Woman gain weight during pregnancy and, some women find it difficult to lose weight after child birth. Not having enough sleep or getting too much sleep can cause changes in hormones that may increase appetite and craving for foods high in calories and carbohydrates, which can contribute to weight gain. 
#Complications - Obesity - 5B81.Z
Obesity can increase the risk of developing many health conditions: Type 2 Diabetes; Hypertension (High blood pressure); Coronary heart disease and stroke; Metabolic syndrome (a combination of diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity); Cancer: Colon cancer, breast cancer in postmenopausal women, endometrial cancer Gallstones (stones in gallbladder); Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease(GORD): condition in which acids from stomach regurgitates in to oesophagus; Asthma; Osteoarthritis: Pain and stiffness in joints; Low back pain; Reduced fertility; Sleep apnoea (interrupted breathing during sleep); Liver disease; Kidney disease; Pregnancy complications such a gestational diabetes, Pre-eclampsia, foetal defects.
#Overview - Obesity - 5B81.Z
Obesity is a condition where a person has accumulated abnormal or excessive body fat that causes negative effects on health. For an individual, obesity is usually the result of an imbalance between calories consumed and calories expanded. An increased consumption of high calorie foods, without an equal increase in physical activity leads to an increase in weight. Decreased levels of physical activity will also result in an energy imbalance and lead to weight gain. World Health Organization (WHO) defines overweight and obesity as abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that presents a risk to health. A simple measure commonly used to classify overweight and obesity in adults is body mass index (BMI).  BMI is defined as a person's weight in kilograms divided by the square of his height in meters (kg/m2). WHO identifies overweight when BMI is greater than or equal to 25; and obesity when BMI is greater or equal to 30. In Asians, the cut-offs for overweight (≥23.0kg/m2) and obesity (≥25.0kg/m2) are lower than WHO criteria due to risk factors and morbidities.
#Diagnosis - Obesity - 5B81.Z
Height and weight are the most simple and commonly used measures. Overweight and obesity can be diagnosed by calculating body mass index (BMI) of an individual. BMI generally correlates with fat accumulation although it can sometimes misclassify total body fat content as seen in athletes who are muscular, have high BMI due to muscle weighing more than fat and will have BMI within the overweight range even though they are not fat. The adult BMI cut-offs are not considered appropriate for children as they are still growing.
#Symptoms - Obesity - 5B81.Z
Weight gain usually occurs over time. Most people know when they've gained weight. Some of the signs of overweight or obesity include: Clothes feeling tight and needing a larger size, Weight gain as compared to previous measurement, Having extra fat around the waist,  A higher than normal body mass index and waist circumference, Breathlessness, Increased sweating, Snoring, Back and joint pains, Feeling tired even with routine activities, Inability to cope with sudden physical activity.
#Prevention - Obesity - 5B81.Z
This is observed that increase in the prevalence of obesity is largely due to the obesogenic environment rather than medical and genetic problems in the individuals. Eating a healthy diet can help in preventing obesity: Limit total fat intake and shift fat consumption away from saturated fats to unsaturated fats and elimination of trans fats. Increase consumption of fruits, vegetables, pulses, whole grains, legumes and nuts. Limit intake of sugar and salt. Regular physical activity helps maintain a healthy weight- People should engage in adequate levels of physical activity. At least 30 minutes of regular, moderate-intensity physical activity on most days reduces the risk of obesity and co-morbidities.
#Treatment - Obesity - 5B81.Z
For most people who are overweight or obese, the safest and most effective way to lose weight is setting goals with life style changes such as eating fewer calories and being physically active. Healthy eating habits: Portion size: Cutting back on portion size is a good way to eat fewer calories. Avoid oversized portions. Use a smaller plate, bowl, and glass. Food weight:  Eat foods that are lower in calories and fat for a given amount of food. Very-low-calorie diet (VLCD): gives less than 800 calories a day. Physical activity. Prescription anti-obesity drugs can be useful adjuncts to diet and exercise for obese adults who have failed to achieve weight loss with diet and exercise. Weight loss surgery: Gastric bypass surgery, Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB), Biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch, Gastric sleeve.
