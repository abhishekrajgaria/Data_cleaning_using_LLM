#Overview - Food Poisoning - 1A10
Food poisoning is illness that results due to the consumption of food or drink which is contaminated with pathogenic bacteria, viruses, parasites, toxins or chemicals. Most people recover without the need for treatment. In most cases, the food that causes the illness has been contaminated by bacteria, such as salmonella or   Escherichia coli, or a virus, such as the norovirus. The contamination of food can occur at any point beginning from growing, till processing and shipping of the product. Improper cooking of the food may also be the cause for contamination other cause can be when pathogens are transferred from one surface to another especially in case of ready-to-eat foods or raw foods. Since these foods aren’t cooked before consumption, pathogens are not destroyed and ingesting them may lead to food poisoning. This is called cross-contamination. Thus the contamination of food may occur at any stage in the process from food production to consumption.

Cross-contamination: Cross-contamination is a cause of food poisoning that is often over  looked. It occurs when harmful bacteria are spread between food, surfaces and equipment. Most common organisms that cause food poisoning: Bacteria- -Campylobacter jejuni. -Clostridium perfringens. -Salmonella species.  . – S. typhi-murium infection -Escherichia coli (E. coli ). Viruses (noro virus). Parasites (Toxoplasmosis).
