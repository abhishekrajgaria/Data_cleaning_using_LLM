#Causes - Shaken Baby Syndrome - PJ20
Head injuries are the chief cause of traumatic death and leading cause of fatalities due to child abuse. Serious injuries in infants, notably those causing death, are rarely accidental unless there is a clear cause for the injuries, such as road traffic accident due to motor vehicle. The majority of all cases of SBS are limited to children under three years of age. Shaking is generally attributed to the perpetrators level of tension and frustration, often generated by infants crying or irritability.
#Complications - Shaken Baby Syndrome - PJ20
Complications may be: Cortical blindness, Acquired microcephalus, Seizure disorders, Chronic subdural fluid collections, Enlargement of ventricles, Cerebral atrophy, Encephalomalacia, Motor, cognitive or learning disabilities, Long term impairment, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, Dementia pugilistica (Boxers’ dementia or Punch drunk syndrome), Post-traumatic dementia.
#Overview - Shaken Baby Syndrome - PJ20
Shaken baby syndrome (SBS) is a violent act of one form of child abuse, a non-accidental traumatic brain injury, which can cause neurologic, cognitive and other functional deficits. Retinal findings may be the only manifestation of SBS and then an eye specialist may initially recognise it. Cases should be thoroughly reviewed and prevention strategies developed to prevent further incidents. SBS has important medico-legal implications since the safety of child may be at stake.
#Diagnosis - Shaken Baby Syndrome - PJ20
Diagnostic procedures: Radiological examination: Skeletal survey should include radiographs of hands, feet, long bones, skull, spine and ribs. Scintigraphy: Scintigraphy is a nuclear medicine test which detects areas of increased or decreased bone metabolism, thus increase sensitivity of detecting rib fractures. Computed tomography (CT scan): CT scan has primary role in imaging evaluation of a child with TBI. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): MRI optimizes detection and assessment of intracranial injury including parenchymal haemorrhage, contusions, oedema and shearing injuries. Spinal tap: If a spinal tap yields bloody cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), a fluid which is xanthochromic (yellowish appearance of CSF) should arouse suspicion that the cerebral trauma may be several hours old and the blood in CSF is not from traumatic spinal tap. Laboratory studies for SBS are nonspecific and are not diagnostic. Leukocytosis is seen in about 50% of cases. Serum chemistry findings are usually normal, but it may reveal evidence of acidosis.
#Prevention - Shaken Baby Syndrome - PJ20
Primary prevention activities are directed at the general population with the goal of ending child abuse and maltreatment. This include: Public service announcements and awareness campaigns, Family support and strengthening programs. Secondary prevention activities are directed to population who possess one or more risk factors associated with abuse or maltreatment. This includes: Parent education programs in targeted area, Home visit programs, Family resource centers located in targeted communities. Tertiary prevention activities focus on families with identified abuse or maltreatment. Programs for tertiary prevention include: Parent mentoring programs, Intensive family preservation services, Mental health services to improve family.
#Risk factors - Shaken Baby Syndrome - PJ20
Risk factors for non-accidental injuries include: Young parents, Unstable family environment, Low socioeconomic status, Unrealistic child-rearing expectations, Infant prematurity or disability, Rigid attitudes and impulsivity, Feelings of inadequacy, isolation or depression, Negative childhood experiences including neglect or abuse, Crying of the infant or child may also play a role.
#Treatment - Shaken Baby Syndrome - PJ20
Management should be strictly under medical supervision. Supportive medical care is the mainstay of management in SBS: Blood pressure and vital signs should be maintained. Resuscitate the child, if required. Manage raised intracranial pressure, if present. Some children require treatment for amblyopia or strabismus due to visual defect developing after SBS. Antiepileptic medication may be indicated for seizures. Physiotherapy and occupational therapy may be helpful after neurological injury. Speech therapy might be of use for patients in whom speech and/or language is affected.
#Symptoms - Shaken Baby Syndrome - PJ20
SBS victims may present with a wide variety of symptoms ranging from very mild to most critical of states. Infant may present with parents or caretaker giving history of: Poor feeding, Vomiting, Lethargy, Irritability, Hypothermia or chills, Generalised failure to thrive, Increased sleeping, Failure to smile, Difficulty in breathing including apnoea, Decreased level of consciousness, Seizures, Bradycardia.
