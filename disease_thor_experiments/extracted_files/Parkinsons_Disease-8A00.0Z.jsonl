#Causes - Parkinsons Disease - 8A00.0Z
Parkinson's disease/ Parkinsonian syndrome is caused by a loss of nerve cells in the part of the brain called the substantia nigra. Nerve cells in this part of the brain are responsible for producing a chemical called dopamine. Dopamine acts as a messenger in the nervous system, and helps control and co-ordinate body movements. If these nerve cells become damaged or die, the amount of dopamine in the brain is reduced. This means that the part of the brain controlling movement cannot work so well, which causes movements to become slow and abnormal. The loss of nerve cells is a slow process.
#Diagnosis - Parkinsons Disease - 8A00.0Z
Diagnosis of Parkinson's disease is essentially a clinical diagnosis from information derived from medical history and neurological examination. There is no imaging or laboratory test that can identify the disease. Brain scans are sometimes used to rule out disorders that could give rise to similar symptoms.
#Prevention - Parkinsons Disease - 8A00.0Z
There is no definitive preventive strategy for Parkinson’s disease. Healthy life style and early diagnosis are helpful in disability limitation and care planning. Caffeine consumption appears to be protective against Parkinson's disease, though the exact mechanism is not clearly understood. Although tobacco smoking decreases life expectancy and quality of life, it may reduce the risk of PD. The protective effect is more related to duration than quantity.  This may be the effect of nicotine as a dopamine stimulant.
#Overview - Parkinsons Disease - 8A00.0Z
Parkinson’s disease is a common chronic degenerative disorder of the central nervous system. It is a disabling disease of the ageing population and affects mobility and locomotion. It is classified as a movement disorder. The motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease results from progressive damage of dopamine-generating cells of “substantia nigra”, of the basal ganglia, a part of the brain situated below the cerebral cortex and is called the mid-brain.
#Treatment - Parkinsons Disease - 8A00.0Z
There is no curative treatment for Parkinson’s diseases and related syndromes as their basic cause is uncertain. In initial stage individual with PD develops some disability for which he needs pharmacological treatment. In the later stage the patient develops motor complications related to levodopa usage. In the second stage the aim is to reduce symptoms while controlling fluctuations of the response to medication. Sudden withdrawals from medication or overuse have to be managed. Surgery: When medications are not enough to control symptoms, surgery and deep brain stimulation can be of use. In the final stages of the disease, palliative care is provided to improve quality of life.
#Symptoms - Parkinsons Disease - 8A00.0Z
The three most important symptoms are: Rest tremors: Uncontrollable shaking of a limb or a part of the body is known as tremor. Bradykinesia or slowness of movements: It is another characteristic feature of PD which is associated with difficulties along the course of the movement process, from planning to initiation and finally execution of a movement. Muscle stiffness or rigidity: Stiffness and resistance to limb movement is known as rigidity and is caused by increased muscle tone, an excessive and continuous contraction of muscles. Other motor symptoms include: Mask like face, Reduced eye blink, Soft voice, Dysphagia, Dyskinesia or involuntary muscle cramps, Mood disorders such as depression, Sleep disturbance, Cognitive impairment or dementia, Sensory symptoms such as loss of smell sensation and pain, Fainting, Disturbance of bowel and bladder, Sexual dysfunction.
