Acquired causes Acquired causes lead to hearing loss at any age. Infectious diseases such as meningitis, measles and mumps can lead to loss of hearing especially in childhood but can also occur in later life. Chronic ear infection, which commonly presents as discharging ears, can lead to hearing loss. In certain cases this condition can also lead to serious, life-threatening complications, such as brain abscess or meningitis.
