#Causes - Astigmatism - 9D00.2
Astigmatism may be natural, traumatic following a wound or surgically induced as is seen following cataract surgery. Tight sutures after surgery further accentuate astigmatism. I. Regular astigmatism may be Corneal astigmatism: It is due to abnormalities in corneal curvature. This is the commonest type and is usually congenital. Lenticular astigmatism: This is relatively less common. Retinal astigmatism: Occasionally, obliquity of macula may produce retinal astigmatism. II. Irregular astigmatism may be Corneal irregular astigmatism: Extensive corneal scarring or ectatic conditions like keratoconus may produce this. Lenticular irregular astigmatism: This may be produced due to variable refractive index in different parts of the crystalline lens and rarely may occur during maturation of cataract. Retinal irregular astigmatism: It may be produced by distortion of the macular area due to scarring or tumours of retina and choroid pushing the macular area.
#Diagnosis - Astigmatism - 9D00.2
Diagnosis of astigmatism depends upon the symptoms and clinical features. Refractive error may be determined by: Retinoscopy, Astigmatic fan test, Jackson cross- cylinder test, Keratometry, Corneal topography, Very high frequency (VHF) digital ultrasound arc scanner, Wavefront aberrometry. Types of regular astigmatism: Based upon the axis and the angle between two principal meridia, regular astigmatism may be classified into: With-the-rule astigmatism, Against-the-rule astigmatism, Oblique astigmatism, Bi-oblique astigmatism. Refractive types of regular astigmatism: Depending upon the position of two focal lines in relation to retina, regular astigmatism is classified into: Simple astigmatism, Compound astigmatism, Mixed astigmatism.
#Symptoms - Astigmatism - 9D00.2
Symptoms vary according to the degree and type of regular astigmatism and may include: Blurring of vision: Patients with low astigmatism show transient blurring of vision, which is relieved by closing or rubbing the eyes. Eyes become fatigued with reading and the letters are described as ‘running together’. Symptoms of asthenopia (eye strain): Symptoms of asthenopia (eye strain) include tiredness of eyes, headache, irritability, dizziness and fatigue. Narrowing of eyes: Narrowing of eyes may be resorted to in cases having high astigmatism to see clear. Narrowing produces a stenopaeic slit effect which cuts down the light rays in one meridian. Head tilt: Some patients with high oblique astigmatism may keep the head tilted to one side to avoid distortion of image. Holding books close to eyes: Many patients with high astigmatism may hold the books close to the eyes in a bid to achieve larger image. Burning. Itching.
#Overview - Astigmatism - 9D00.2
Astigmatism is a type of refractive error wherein the refraction varies in different meridian. As a result, the light rays entering the eye cannot converge to a point focus but form focal lines. Astigmatism is divided as Regular astigmatism: It is correctable with cylindrical or sphero-cylindrical lenses. Irregular astigmatism: It is not correctable with cylindrical or sphero-cylindrical lenses. In astigmatism, the eye has different refractive powers along different meridians. Light entering in vertical direction gets focused differently than light in the horizontal direction. The meridian of steeper curvature has greater refractive power. The astigmatic eye produces a blurred image because two focal lines of images are being produced. This requires different corrections along each of these meridians to produce a single focused image on the retina.
#Treatment - Astigmatism - 9D00.2
Medical optical therapy: Optical therapy of regular astigmatism comprises of prescribing appropriate cylindrical lenses. The cylindrical lenses may be prescribed in the form of Spectacles, Contact lenses. Guidelines for optical correction: Small astigmatism, High astigmatism, Change in astigmatic correction. Surgical therapy: Indications of surgery: Correction of astigmatism by surgery is done when it significantly affects vision. Surgical therapy includes: Laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK), Wavefront- guided LASIK, IntraLASIK (IntraLase), EpiLASIK. Photorefractive keratectomy (PRK), Laser subepithelial keratomileusis (LASEK), Photoastigmatic refractive keratectomy (PARK), Radial keratotomy (RK), Astigmatic keratotomy (AK), Refractive lens exchange (RLE), Phakic intraocular lens (phakic IOL) implant, Penetrating keratoplasty.
