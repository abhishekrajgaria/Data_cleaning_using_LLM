#Overview - Filamentary Keratitis - 9A78.Z
Filamentary keratitis is a chronic disorder in which filaments, which are adherent complexes of mucus and corneal epithelium, are present on the corneal surface. Filaments consist of a variable combination of degenerated epithelial cells and mucous which are attached to the corneal surface at one end.  Filamentary keratitis can be a functionally debilitating and sight threatening feature of a number of ocular and systemic conditions such as: Keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eye syndrome), Exposure keratitis, Adenoviral keratitis, Bacterial keratitis, Acne rosacea, Systemic use of antihistamines.
#Diagnosis - Filamentary Keratitis - 9A78.Z
Diagnosis of filamentary keratitis is based on the clinical history and slit lamp examination (bio-microscopy), being conducted by an eye specialist. Signs on slit lamp examination: Corneal filaments (mucoepithelioid strands): There may be multiple small, grey, mucoid filamentary attachments, firmly adherent to the corneal surface. Location of the filament may help determine the underlying cause, Filaments in dry eye syndrome and exposure keratopathy: Filaments in dry eye syndrome and exposure keratopathy are usually found in the interpalpebral space. Filaments due to ptosis, prolonged lid closure or superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis: Filaments due to ptosis, prolonged lid closure or superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis are seen superiorly on cornea. Filaments due to ocular surgery: Filaments due to ocular surgery are found at the site of wound or surgical trauma.
#Riskfactor - Filamentary Keratitis - 9A78.Z
Common risk factors include: Aqueous tear deficiency: Aqueous tear deficiency as in keratoconjunctivitis sicca. Systemic diseases having effects on the corneal surface: Systemic diseases (e.g. Sj√∂gren syndrome) having effects on the corneal surface. Corneal exposure: Corneal exposure as in seventh cranial nerve palsy. Ocular surgery: Ocular surgery (e.g. keratoplasty, cataract surgery). Anti-cholinergic medicines: Use of anti-cholinergic medicines for long periods. Ptosis (drooping) of upper eyelids: Ptosis (drooping) of upper eyelids may lead to poor tear distribution and reduction in oxygenation of the corneal epithelium.
#Symptoms - Filamentary Keratitis - 9A78.Z
Patient with Filamentary keratitis may have ocular (eye) symptoms like: Foreign body sensation. Redness. Increased blinking. Discomfort. Lacrimation or watering. Photophobia (sensitivity to light). Blurring of vision. Blepharospasm (abnormal contraction of eyelid muscles).
#Treatment - Filamentary Keratitis - 9A78.Z
Treatment should be carried out under medical supervision. Medical therapy: Topical artificial tears, Topical sodium chloride, N-acetylcysteine, Bandage contact lens, Topical corticosteroids, Topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Surgical therapy: Debridement of filaments, Occlusion of punctum. Prognosis: Prognosis of filamentary keratitis is generally good and it depends upon the effectiveness in managing the predisposing condition.
