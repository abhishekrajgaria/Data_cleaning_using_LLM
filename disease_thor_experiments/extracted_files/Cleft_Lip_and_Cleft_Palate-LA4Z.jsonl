Birth defects are health conditions that are present at birth and they change the shape or function of one or more body parts. During the development of lip and palate in early pregnancy period, incomplete fusion of upper lip and palate leads to the formation of cleft lip and palate in a child. A child can have a cleft lip, a cleft palate or both because development of lips and palate occur at different times during gestation. Children with these birth defects have difficulty in feeding and talking. They are also prone to ear infections, hearing loss, and dental problems.

The diagnosis of cleft lip at birth is obvious whereas to rule out cleft palate, direct illuminated examination of the infant's hard and soft palate is done. Palpation of hard and soft palate is also done to ensure that a partial cleft is not missed. Prenatal ultrasound may demonstrate deformities like cleft lip and palate.
