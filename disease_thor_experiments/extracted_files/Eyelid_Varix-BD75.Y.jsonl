#Diagnosis - Eyelid Varix - BD75.Y
Diagnosis of eyelid varix is clinical. Eyelid varix is a well defined soft dark blue or brown lesion without any associated palpable thrill or bruit. The lesion increases in size with any activity which raises venous pressure such as Valsalva manoeuvre. CT scan: Since most of eyelid varices may have orbital extension, a CT scan may be needed in those with orbital clinical signs.
#Causes - Eyelid Varix - BD75.Y
Eyelid varix is caused probably due to congenital or acquired weakness of the involved vein, or due to obstruction of the venous circulation. Eyelid varices may result due to: An arteriovenous malformation, Compression by an arterial aneurysm or a tumour, Infection, Trauma involving wall or lumen of the vein.
#Symptoms - Eyelid Varix - BD75.Y
Eyelid varix may present with symptoms such as: Soft brown or blue lesion which increases with increase in venous pressure. Organised thrombus may show haemosiderin and calcification. Ruptured varix may show haemorrhage and lid ecchymosis. Haemorrhage in deep associated orbital varix may present with acute pain, proptosis and restriction of ocular movements.
#Overview - Eyelid Varix - BD75.Y
Eyelid Varix is an abnormal dilatation of one or more normal blood vessels. Varices of the eyelids are usually an extension forward of the orbital varices into the eyelid. These probably are congenital or acquired weakness of the affected vein, or to an obstruction of the venous circulation. Varices may result due to: An arteriovenous malformation, Compression by an arterial aneurysm or a tumour, Infection, Trauma involving wall or lumen of the vein, Varices resulting from infection or trauma may get thrombosed.
#Treatment - Eyelid Varix - BD75.Y
Eyelid varices may be just observed and followed up in most of the cases. It is possible to treat a small varix just like haemangioma with a precooled probe when applied with little pressure. Ectatic periocular veins may be tried with sclerotherapy. Surgical therapy: Patient with eyelid dysfunction or requiring cosmetic correction may undergo surgical excision.
