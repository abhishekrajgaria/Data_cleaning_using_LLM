High levels of these hormones affect the development and release of eggs from ovary each month (process called ovulation).
#Diagnosis - Polycystic Ovary Syndrome - 5A80.1
Tests for evaluation of PCOS: Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), Lutenizing hormone, Testosterone, Estrogens. Tests to rule out other conditions with similar signs and symptoms: Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) – to rule out thyroid dysfunction. Cortisol– to rule out Cushing syndrome. Dehydroepiandrosterone Sulfate (DHEAS)  – to rule out an adrenal tumor. Other blood tests to check a woman's health and detect any complications: Glucose or Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) – can be used to detect diabetes; elevated in diabetes. Insulin– often elevated in insulin resistance. Imaging tests: The following imaging studies may be used in the evaluation of PCOS: Ovarian ultrasonography, preferably using transvaginal approach. Pelvic CT scan or MRI to visualize the adrenals and ovaries.

#Overview - Polycystic Ovary Syndrome - 5A80.1
Polycystic ovary syndrome causes irregular menstrual cycles, excessive body or facial hair and polycystic ovaries as its main symptoms. Polycystic means "many cysts," and PCOS often causes clusters of small, pearl-sized cysts in the ovaries. The cysts are fluid-filled and contain immature eggs. Women with PCOS produce slightly higher amounts of male hormones known as androgens, which contribute to some of the symptoms of the condition. Early diagnosis of PCOS is important as it has been linked to an increased risk for developing several medical conditions including insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, high cholesterol, high blood pressure and heart disease.
