#Complication - Recurrent Corneal Erosion Syndrome - 9A78.8
Complications may be: Corneal haze. Corneal scarring. Infectious keratitis, occurring as a result of prolonged bandage contact lens use and topical steroids. Diminution of vision.
#Overview - Recurrent Corneal Erosion Syndrome - 9A78.8
Recurrent Corneal Erosion Syndrome (RCES), a corneal epithelial adhesion disorder, is a painful, often frightening, and sometimes incapacitating condition of the cornea. Corneal epithelial cells undergo erosions and results in denuded areas on the corneal surface. These areas then re-epithelise, the process recurs and the epithelial cells slough again. With many patients, erosions are characteristically episodic in nature.
#Symptoms - Recurrent Corneal Erosion Syndrome - 9A78.8
Patients with RCES may experience ocular (eye) symptoms (may be triggered by a trivial mechanical trauma), typically on awakening, such as: Mild to severe pain. Discomfort. Watering. Redness. Photophobia. Foreign body sensation. Slightly blurred vision, if the visual axis is affected. Diminution of vision. Monocular (one eye) diplopia. Astigmatism. Epithelial blebs. Lid swelling.
#Treatment - Recurrent Corneal Erosion Syndrome - 9A78.8
Medical therapy: Medical therapy includes: Slow eye movements on awakening and gradual lid opening. Patching and a topical antibiotic ointment. Topical artificial tears (lubricants). Hyper-osmotic agents. Other medical therapy includes: Osmotic colloidal solutions. Autologous serum. Trophic growth factors (TGFs). Botulinum toxin induced ptosis (drooping of eyelid). Surgical therapy: In patients where consistent, aggressive medical management fails to resolve the erosions, surgical therapy may be required. Prognosis: Overall, the prognosis is very good to excellent with proper care.
#Causes - Recurrent Corneal Erosion Syndrome - 9A78.8
Causes of RCES are either primary or secondary depending on whether the basement membrane complex abnormalities are intrinsic or acquired. Secondary erosive disorders encompass all the conditions except corneal dystrophies. RCES is classified as (Das et al, 2008): Primary (Intrinsic): Epithelial basement membrane dystrophy, Dystrophy involving Bowmanâ€™s membrane, Stromal dystrophy. Secondary (Acquired): Degeneration, Trauma, Eyelid pathology, Following ocular (eye) infection, Following refractive surgery, Systemic causes such as: Diabetes mellitus, Epidermolysis bullosa (a mucocutaneous autoimmune disease).
#Diagnosis - Recurrent Corneal Erosion Syndrome - 9A78.8
Clinical signs at slit- lamp (bio-microscopy) may show: Delicate signs of basement membrane dystrophy. Sites of previous erosion. Clusters of small epithelial micro-cysts. Features of acute attack or during the first few days following the attack, in corneal epithelium: Epithelial micro-cysts. Corneal epithelial defects. Meibomian gland dysfunction. When no obvious signs of RCE are evident on the slit lamp examination, the presence of impaired epithelial adhesion is detected by: Test for epithelial adherence, Corneal topography (using computerised videokeratography), Histology, Confocal microscopy, Electron microscopy.
#Prevention - Recurrent Corneal Erosion Syndrome - 9A78.8
Preventive measures/ deterrence for RCES may be: Avoid dry irritating environment. Avoid keeping awake late night, since corneal hydration from lid closure may be a factor affecting epithelial adhesion. Slow eye movements on awakening and gradual lid opening. Use lubricating ointment at bedtime, may be for months or even years, to prevent any recurrence. Maintain air quality and humidity of the room while sleeping. Avoid exposure to infections, such as viruses. Wear protective glasses while engaging in certain activities to avoid trauma to the eyes.
