#Causes - Ankyloblepharon - LA14.07
Various aetiologies for acquired ankyloblepharon have been described: Chemical injuries to the eyes, Burns, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, Post traumatic prolonged contact of upper and lower eyelid, Trachoma, Ulcerative blepharitis, Herpes simplex blepharoconjunctivitis, Diphtheritic conjunctivitis.
#Diagnosis - Ankyloblepharon - LA14.07
Diagnosis of ankyloblepharon is based on clinical features. Congenital ankyloblepharon: The eyelid margins are usually fused laterally, and less commonly medially. This condition may be associated with other developmental anomalies such as ptosis, microphthalmos, anophthalmos, or cleft lip. Acquired ankyloblepharon: Commonly, acquired ankyloblepharon is due to progressive conjunctival scarring resulting in fusion of the eyelids. Patients usually have a history of progressive scarring related to the primary disease. The eyelids show fusion from scar tissue.


#Symptoms - Ankyloblepharon - LA14.07
Patients may have symptoms such as: Complete, partial, or interrupted fusion of upper and lower eyelids. Horizontal foreshortening of the palpebral fissure. Pseudoexotropia due to lateral ankyloblepharon. Pseudoesotropia due to medial ankyloblepharon. Reduced eyelid excursion. Associated features such as anophthalmos (absence of eyeball), microphthalmos (small eyeball), ptosis (drooping of eyelid), or cleft lip. Downward displacement of lateral canthal angle. Large fluid cyst due to accumulation of lacrimal tears in cases of total ankyloblepharon.
#Overview - Ankyloblepharon - LA14.07
Ankyloblepharon is defined as adhesion of the edges of upper eyelid with the lower eyelid. The eyelids maintain their integrity and identity. The condition is usually congenital but may be acquired. In congenital ankyloblepharon, the fused eyelids fail to separate completely during development of embryo. Congenital ankyloblepharon is caused by developmental arrest leading to aberration in growth at either medial or lateral canthus. It may occur as a sporadic finding or in association with chromosomal/syndromic conditions. Ankyloblepharon may also develop following: chemical injuries to the eyes, Trauma, Cicatrising diseases such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome or cicatricial ocular pemphigoid, Inflammatory diseases such as herpes simplex infection or ulcerative blepharitis.
#Treatment - Ankyloblepharon - LA14.07
Treatment should be carried out under medical supervision. Indications for therapy in cases of congenital and acquired cases of ankyloblepharon are similar. Presence of a significant central ankyloblepharon may occlude vision. In congenital type, it may potentially cause an occlusion type amblyopia. A significant nasal or temporal ankyloblepharon may restrict peripheral vision. Normal opening and closing of eyes may also be affected. Surgical therapy: A potential contraindication to ankyloblepharon surgery is the problem of corneal exposure following release of marginal adhesions. This is significant in cases of ankyloblepharon developing after trauma, since other injuries such as damage to fifth and seventh intracranial nerve may be present.
