#Causes - Middle East Respiratory Syndrome - 1D64
MERS-CoV is a zoonotic virus, which means virus can be transmitted between animals and people. Humans have got infection with MERS-CoV through direct or indirect contact with infected dromedary camels. Dromedary camels are the major reservoir host for MERS-CoV and an animal source of infection in humans. It is believed that in past the virus may have originated in bats and then transmitted to camels.
#Diagnosis - Middle East Respiratory Syndrome - 1D64
There are two tests to detect MERS-CoV infection. Molecular Tests-Real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR)-These tests are used to detect active infection (presence of MERS-CoV) in people who are thought to infected with MERS-CoV based on their clinical symptoms and having links to places where MERS-CoV has been reported. Serology Tests-These tests are used to detect previous infection in people who may have been exposed to the virus, by detecting antibodies to MERS-CoV. (Antibodies are proteins produced by the body’s immune system to attack and kill viruses, bacteria, and other microbes during infection).
#Overview - Middle East Respiratory Syndrome - 1D64
Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a viral respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus that was first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012. The novel coronavirus was named as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, or MERS‐CoV. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause diseases ranging from the common cold to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).
#Prevention - Middle East Respiratory Syndrome - 1D64
Prevention: No vaccine or specific treatment is currently available, however several MERS-CoV specific vaccines and treatments are in development. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands. Avoid personal contact, such as kissing, or sharing cups or eating utensils, with sick people. Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces and objects, such as doorknobs.Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze or you can cough or sneeze into your sleeve.Wash your hands often with soap and water, and help young children do the same. People with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are at high risk of severe disease from MERS-CoV infection.
#Symptoms - Middle East Respiratory Syndrome - 1D64
The clinical presentation of MERS-CoV infection may be asymptomatic showing no symptoms or may show mild respiratory symptoms to severe acute respiratory disease and death. Typical symptoms of MERS-CoV disease are: Fever, Cough, shortness of breath, pneumonia, respiratory failure: severe illness can cause respiratory failure, gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhoea.
#Treatment - Middle East Respiratory Syndrome - 1D64
Treatment is supportive and based on the patient’s clinical condition. Severe illness can result into respiratory failure that requires mechanical ventilation and support in an intensive care unit.
