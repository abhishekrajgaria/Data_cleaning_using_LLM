#Causes - Oral Cancer - 2B6E.Z
Oncogenes (genes that causes cancer) are activated as a result of mutation of the DNA.
#Diagnosis - Oral Cancer - 2B6E.Z
Biopsy: It may be necessary to remove a small sample of affected tissue to check for the presence of cancerous cells. Punch biopsy: A punch biopsy may be used if the suspected affected area of tissue is in an easily accessible place, such as your tongue or the inside of your mouth. Fine needle aspiration (FNA): A fine needle aspiration (FNA) is a type of biopsy used if it is suspected a swelling in neck is the result of mouth cancer. Pan endoscopy: A panendoscopy is a procedure used to obtain a biopsy when the suspected tissue is at the back of throat or inside nasal cavities. The tests that may be used include: An X-ray, A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, A computerised tomography (CT) scan, A positron emission tomography (PET) scan.

Oral cancer, a type of mouth cancer, where cancerous tissues grows in the oral cavity . Oral or mouth cancer most commonly involves the tongue. It may also occur on the floor of the mouth, cheek lining, gingiva (gums), lips or palate (roof of the mouth). Most oral cancers look very similar under the microscope and are called squamous cell carcinoma. Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common type of mouth cancer. Squamous cells are found in many places around the body, including the inside of the mouth and under the skin. Less common types of mouth cancer include: Oral malignant melanoma, Adenocarcinomas.
#Riskfactor - Oral Cancer - 2B6E.Z
Various risk factors are: Smoking and alcohol: The two leading causes of mouth cancer are smoking cigarettes (or other tobacco products, such as pipes or cigars) and drinking too much alcohol. Betel nuts: Betel nuts are mildly addictive seeds taken from the betel palm tree, and are widely used in many southeast Asian communities, such as people of Indian and Sri Lankan origin. Smokeless tobacco: Smokeless tobacco is a general term used to refer to a range of products, such as: Chewing tobacco, Snuff – powdered tobacco designed to be snorted, Snus – a type of smokeless tobacco. Cannabis: Smoking cannabis has also been linked to an increased risk of mouth cancer. Human papilloma virus (HPV): The human papilloma virus (HPV) is the name of a family of viruses that affect the skin and moist membranes that line your body, such as those in your cervix, anus, mouth and throat. Poor oral hygiene: There is evidence that poor oral hygiene, such as having tooth decay, gum disease, not brushing your teeth regularly and having ill-fitted dentures (false teeth) can increase your risk of mouth cancer.
#Symptoms - Oral Cancer - 2B6E.Z
Symptoms include: Red or red and white, patches on the lining of mouth or tongue, One or more mouth ulcers that do not heal after three weeks, Swelling in mouth that lasts for more than three weeks, Pain when swallowing (dysphagia), A persistent pain in the neck, A hoarse voice, Unexplained weight loss, Unusual changes in sense of taste, Pain in ear, The lymph nodes (glands) in neck become swollen.

#Treatment - Oral Cancer - 2B6E.Z
Surgery: For mouth cancer, the aim of surgical treatment is to remove any affected tissue while minimizing damage to the rest of the mouth. Photodynamic therapy (PDT): If the cancer is in its early stages, it may be possible to remove any tumors using a type of laser surgery known as photodynamic therapy (PDT). Radiotherapy: It uses doses of radiation to kill cancerous cells. Chemotherapy: It is often used in combination with radiotherapy when the cancer is widespread, or if it is thought there is a significant risk of the cancer returning.
