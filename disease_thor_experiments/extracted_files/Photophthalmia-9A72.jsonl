#Causes - Photophthalmia - 9A72
Photophthalmia may be caused due to exposure to short wavelength. Exposure of naked eye to exposed arc light: This may be seen in cases exposed to industrial welding. It is also seen in cinema studios. Snow blindness: It is produced by reflected ultraviolet rays from snow surface. In snow blindness, the cause is similar, since the ultraviolet rays are reflected from snow surfaces. Short circuiting: This is due to exposure to bright light being produced on short circuiting.
#Diagnosis - Photophthalmia - 9A72
Diagnosis depends upon the clinical history and signs observed on examination. The symptoms in eye appear characteristically after a latent period of 4- 5 hours of exposure to ultra-violet light. There is intense burning pain, foreign body sensation, and watering of eyes. There is associated marked photophobia and blepharospasm. On slit-lamp examination, corneal epithelium shows breach in continuity of epithelium which takes up fluorescein sodium stain. In severe cases, the epithelium of the cornea is detached, which may result in corneal erosion. There is conjunctival erythema (redness). There may be presence of retro-tarsal folds.
#Overview - Photophthalmia - 9A72
Photophthalmia is produced due to exposure to short wavelength ultraviolet (UV) rays (especially in wavelength range of 311- 290 nanometer). The cornea absorbs ultraviolet radiation. This may be associated with: Exposure of naked eye to arc light, Snow blindness, Short circuiting.
#Symptoms - Photophthalmia - 9A72
Symptoms of photophthalmia usually manifest with a latent period of about 4- 5 hours after exposure to ultraviolet rays. It includes: Extreme burning pain. Intense foreign body sensation. Lacrimation or watering. Redness. Marked photophobia (aversion to light). Blepharospasm (abnormal contraction of eyelid muscles). Swelling of palpebral conjunctiva.
#Treatment - Photophthalmia - 9A72
General prophylactic therapy: Prophylactic therapy consists of wearing dark glasses when exposure is anticipated. Material such as Crookes glass may be used, since it cuts off nearly all the ultraviolet and infrared rays. Medical therapy: It comprises of Cold compresses, Lubricant eye drops, Bandaging.
