#Causes - Mouth Ulcers - DA01.15
Aphthous ulcers are idiopathic (exact cause is not clear) and multifactorial, but likely involves activation of the cell-mediated immune system. These factors may include: Local trauma due to badly fitting dentures, braces, rough fillings or a sharp tooth, cuts or burns while eating or drinking hard food or hot drinks Emotional or physiologic stress, hormonal states (menstruation or pregnancy) Food hypersensitivity (such as cinnamon, cheese, citrus, figs or pineapple), sensitivity to sodium lauryl sulfate and certain medications (NSAIDs, beta-blockers or nicorandil). Many cases are related to iron, folic acid, vitamin B6 or B12 deficiency. Family history, immunological, and microbial factors are important in the onset of recurrent aphthous ulcerations. Systemic illness such as malabsorption, enteropathy, coeliac disease/inflammatory bowel disease, vasculitis (e.g., Behcet’s syndrome), reactive arthritis (e.g., Reiter’s syndrome), and HIV/AIDS. Aphthous stomatitis is more prevalent in non-smokers and smokers who quit smoking. Less common in individuals with good oral hygiene practices.
#Diagnosis - Mouth Ulcers - DA01.15
Based on the clinical examination and on the patient’s medical history, a diagnosis of aphthous ulcers is determined.
#Prevention - Mouth Ulcers - DA01.15
Keep your mouth as clean as possible. Use a soft toothbrush. Do not brush vigorously. Drink cool drinks through a straw. Do not eat very spicy, salty or acidic food, rough or crunchy food. Eat soft food items. Do not drink very hot or acidic drinks, such as fruit juice. Eat a healthy, balanced diet rich in vitamins A, C and E. Do not use toothpaste containing sodium lauryl sulphate. Regular Dental visits. Do not use chewing gum.
#Overview - Mouth Ulcers - DA01.15
Mouth ulcers are usually pale or yellow painful sores with a red outer ring. These appear inside mouth, on the cheeks, lips and sometimes can also appear on the tongue. Usually a single ulcer inside mouth may be due to cheek or tongue biting, or damage caused by sharp teeth, aggressive brushing or poorly fitting dentures. These ulcers are known as ‘traumatic' ulcers. More than one ulcer inside mouth which are recurrent in nature are called Recurrent Aphthous Stomatitis (RAS).
#Symptoms - Mouth Ulcers - DA01.15
Aphthous ulcers present as well-circumscribed lesions with central necrotic region of gray, fibrinous exudate surrounded by an erythematous halo on the non-keratinised oral mucosa. Pain severity depends on the type of ulcer. Typical locations of ulcers include the buccal (cheek) and labial (lip) mucosa, the floor of the mouth, the ventral surface of the tongue, and the soft palate.
#Treatment - Mouth Ulcers - DA01.15
TREATMENT: The treatment to speed up healing, prevention of recurrent episodes and to reduce pain, depends on the cause of the ulcers: Sometimes only a sharp tooth needs to be smoothed down or a denture adjusted. Topical analgesic pastes to reduce ulcer pain, apply as needed. Protective bio adhesives Antimicrobials Topical corticosteroid agents Patients who suffer from frequent, recurrent episodes of aphthous ulcers should be referred to either an oral medicine/oral pathology specialist or their physician to rule out any possible systemic association, other infections (Herpes simplex virus), chronic mucocutaneous diseases (e.g., lichen planus, pemphigus, pemphigoid), thrush (also called Candidiasis or moniliasis-a fungal infection), cancer.
