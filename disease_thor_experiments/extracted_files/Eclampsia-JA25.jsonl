#Complications - Eclampsia - JA25
Effects of eclampsia on mother: Maternal death: The main causes of maternal death in eclampsia are inhalation of vomit or other secretions, pulmonary oedema, pneumonia, kidney failure, liver failure intracerebral haemorrhage, and failure of more than one organ (e.g. heart + liver + kidney). Effects of eclampsia on the fetus: It causes placental dysfunction which may lead to intrauterine growth restriction, hypoxia, and intrauterine death. Hypoxia may cause brain damage if severe or prolonged, and can result in physical or mental disability.
#Causes - Eclampsia - JA25
The causes of preeclampsia and eclampsia are not known. The common pathophysiology of preeclampsia results from: Vasoconstriction with exaggerated response to vasoactive substances, Plasma volume reduction due to capillary leakage and redistribution and shift of the extracellular volume from the intravascular to the interstitial compartments, Platelet aggregation triggered by endothelial dysfunction which leads to intravascular thrombosis.
#Diagnosis - Eclampsia - JA25
Diagnosis of eclampsia is done with the medical history and clinical examination along with some tests/ investigations. Urine test: The urine will show presence of protein. Blood tests for renal and liver function tests and coagulation; and may show impaired renal and liver function and coagulation defects in women with eclampsia. Blood film examination is done to exclude malaria.
#Overview - Eclampsia - JA25
Eclampsia is the onset of fits (convulsions) in a woman whose pregnancy is usually complicated by pre-eclampsia. Pre-eclampsia almost always precedes eclampsia. However, not all cases follow an orderly progression from mild to severe disease and some women develop severe pre-eclampsia or eclampsia very suddenly. Among the hypertensive disorders, preeclampsia and eclampsia have the greatest impact on maternal and newborn morbidity and mortality. Majority of deaths related to pre-eclampsia and eclampsia could be avoided by timely and effective antenatal care and hospital delivery.
#Symptoms - Eclampsia - JA25
Symptoms and signs of eclampsia: May have headache, visual disturbance, epigastric pain, Well-defined stages of fit but no characteristic warning with which patient is familiar, Convulsions, Diastolic blood 90mm Hg or more after 20 weeks gestation, Proteinuria 2+ or more, May be unconscious, May pass less than 400ml urine in 24 hours, May have pulmonary oedema.
#Prevention - Eclampsia - JA25
Education of women, families and the community about the disease and the importance of early and regular antenatal care, may promote early detection and treatment of the disease. All women should be checked for pre-eclampsia at each antenatal visit. Sometimes women with pre-eclampsia do not feel ill until the condition is severe. Early detection of preeclampsia by regular antenatal monitoring and careful follow-up of those with mild pre-eclampsia is therefore essential for the early diagnosis and treatment of severe preeclampsia. Thus eclampsia can be prevented by proper management of preeclampsia.
#Treatment - Eclampsia - JA25
Eclampsia is managed with the following steps: Making sure the airways are clear and the woman can breathe. Controlling the fits. Controlling the blood pressure. General care and monitoring, including controlling fluid balance. Delivering the baby. Monitoring carefully to prevent further fits and identify complications.
