#Causes - Sarcoma - 2A60.39
Cancer generally begins with the change in the DNA structure known as mutations.
#Diagnosis - Sarcoma - 2A60.39
rays: X-rays can often detect damage to the bones that is caused by cancer or any new bone that's growing because of cancer. MRI scan: An MRI scan is an effective way of assessing the size and spread of any cancerous tumor inside the bones. Biopsy: The other most definitive way of diagnosing bone cancer is to take a sample of affected bone and send it to a laboratory for testing. This is known as a biopsy.
#Symptoms - Sarcoma - 2A60.39
The most common symptom of bone cancer is bone pain. It generally begins with a feeling of tenderness in the affected bone, and then gradually progresses to a persistent ache that often feels worse during the night or while using the affected bone. Others symptoms of bone cancer include: A high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above, Unexplained weight loss,  Sweating usually at night.
#Overview - Sarcoma - 2A60.39
Sarcoma is a cancer that arises from cells of mesenchymal  origin . Malignant tumors made of cancellous  bone, cartilage, fat, muscle, vascular, or hematopoietic tissues are considered sarcomas. There are three main types of sarcoma: soft tissue sarcoma, bone arcoma and gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST) and 100 sub types of sarcoma. The four common types of bone sarcomas are: Osteosarcoma,  Ewing's sarcoma, Chondrosarcoma, Cordoma.
#Treatment - Sarcoma - 2A60.39
Chemotherapy: It is generally done to shrink the size of tumor and to treat any cancerous cells that may have spread. Surgery: Following chemotherapy, surgery may be carried out to remove the section of cancerous bone. In many cases, it is possible to reconstruct the bone that has been removed. This is known as limb-sparing surgery. Following surgery, further chemotherapy treatment may be given to destroy any remaining cancerous cells. Radiotherapy: It is also used for treatment and is particularly helpful for some types of cancer (such as Ewingâ€™s sarcoma).
