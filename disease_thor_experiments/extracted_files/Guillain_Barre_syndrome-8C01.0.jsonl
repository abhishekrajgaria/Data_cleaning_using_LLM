#Causes - Guillain Barre syndrome - 8C01.0
Infections that may trigger GBS include: Campylobacter jejuni which can cause gastrointestinal infection. This bacterium is one of the most common risk factors for GBS. Cytomegalovirus (CMV). Epstein Barr virus. Mycoplasma. Varicella zoster virus. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), dengue, or influenza. Less commonly vaccinations, surgical procedures, and trauma have been reported to trigger the development of GBS.
#Complication - Guillain Barre syndrome - 8C01.0
About three percent of cases may suffer a relapse of muscle weakness and tingling sensations many years after the initial attack. 3%-5% of GBS patients may die from complications, which include: paralysis of the muscles that control breathing, sepsis (blood infection), pulmonary embolism (lung clots), cardiac arrest.
#Overview - Guillain Barre syndrome - 8C01.0
Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is a rare disorder of the peripheral nervous system. GBS is an autoimmune disorder in which a person’s own immune system attacks healthy nerve cells in peripheral nervous system. The syndrome can affect the nerves that control muscle movement and nerves that transmit feelings of pain, temperature and touch. This leads to muscle weakness, numbness, and tingling and sometimes paralysis. The cause of this condition is unknown, but it’s typically triggered by an infectious illness, such as the gastrointestinal infection or a lung infection.
#Diagnosis - Guillain Barre syndrome - 8C01.0
Guillain-Barré syndrome is difficult to diagnose because the symptoms are similar to other neurological disorders. Routine blood tests are done, to exclude other diseases with similar symptoms and for better assessment of functional status and prognosis. Specific tests are required to identify the cause of trigger of GBS. The following tests are used to confirm a diagnosis of GBS: Lumber puncture (Spinal tap), Electromyography, Nerve Conduction Tests, Imaging studies, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scanning of the spine may be helpful in excluding mechanical causes of myelopathy.
#Symptoms - Guillain Barre syndrome - 8C01.0
The symptoms of Guillain-Barré syndrome include: tingling or prickly sensations in fingers and toes, muscle weakness in legs that travels to upper body and gets worse over time, difficulty in walking steadily, difficulty in moving eyes or face, talking, chewing, or swallowing, severe lower back pain, loss of bladder control, fast heart rate, difficulty in breathing, paralysis.
#Prevention - Guillain Barre syndrome - 8C01.0
Primary prevention: Guillain-Barré syndrome is a condition (not a disease itself), and its causation is not known exactly. Therefore no specific preventive measure can be indicated. As there is increase in cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome in areas where Zika virus is circulating and researchers are investigating to prove the link between the two, WHO recommends that anyone living in or traveling to areas where the Zika virus is circulating take precautions to avoid mosquito bites. Secondary prevention: When possible, patients should be treated in an intensive care unit in order to keep continuous monitoring and to respond immediately to any urgency. Rehabilitation services combined with psychological counseling would be helpful in recovery of the patients.
#Treatment - Guillain Barre syndrome - 8C01.0
The goal of treatment is to lessen the severity of symptoms and maintain vital functions normal while nervous system recovers. Supportive therapy: Respiratory management, Cardiovascular management, Prophylaxis for prevention of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), Pain management. Immunotheraphy: Intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG), Plasmapheresis (Plasma Exchange). Rehabilitation services.
