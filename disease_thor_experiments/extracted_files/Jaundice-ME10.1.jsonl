#Causes - Jaundice - ME10.1
Jaundice is classified into three categories, depending on which part of the physiological mechanism the pathology affects. The three categories are: Pre-hepatic jaundice: Pre hepatic jaundice is due to increased rate of haemolysis (breakdown of RBCs). Causes of haemolysis include: Malaria, Sickle cell anemia, Thalassaemia, Gilbert syndrome. Hepatocellular jaundice: Hepato cellular jaundice can be due to any infection in the liver. It can be due to infection or exposure to a harmful substance, such as alcohol, disrupts the liverâ€™s ability to process bilirubin. Post hepatic jaundice: Post-hepatic jaundice, is also called as obstructive jaundice, is caused by an interruption to the drainage of bile in the biliary system.
#Diagnosis - Jaundice - ME10.1
Urine test: It is used to measure levels of a substance called urobilinogen. Blood tests: Blood tests include blood levels of enzymes found primarily from the liver, such as the aminotransferases (ALT, AST), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP), bilirubin (which causes the jaundice), and protein levels, specifically, total protein and albumin. Other primary lab tests for liver function include gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) and prothrombin time (PT).
#Overview - Jaundice - ME10.1
Jaundice is a term used to describe the yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes. It's caused by a build-up of a substance called bilirubin in the blood and body's tissues. Any condition that disrupts the movement of bilirubin from the blood to the liver and out of the body can cause jaundice. Bilirubin is a yellow pigment that is formed by the breakdown of dead red blood cells (RBC) in the liver.
#Prevention - Jaundice - ME10.1
It's not possible to prevent all cases of jaundice because it can be caused by a wide range of conditions or circumstances. However, by taking certain precautions risk of developing jaundice can be minimised. These include: Ensuring not to exceed the recommended daily amount (RDA) for alcohol consumption. Maintaining a healthy weight for height and build. Vaccination against hepatitis A and hepatitis B. Avoid high-risk behaviours such as intravenous drug use or unprotected intercourse. Avoid potentially contaminated food/water and maintain good hygiene. Avoid medications and toxins which can cause hemolysis or directly damage the liver.
#Symptoms - Jaundice - ME10.1
The main symptoms of jaundice are: Yellow discoloration of the eyes and of the skin, Pale coloured stools (faeces), Dark coloured urine.
#Treatment - Jaundice - ME10.1
There's no treatment for jaundice as such, but disease can be managed by managing symptoms and causes of jaundice. Pre-hepatic jaundice: In cases of infections, such as malaria, the use of medication to treat the underlying infection is usually recommended. For genetic blood disorders, such as sickle cell anemia or thalassemia, blood transfusions may be required to replace the red blood cells. Intra-hepatic jaundice: In cases of intra-hepatic jaundice, there's little that can be done to repair any liver damage, although the liver can often repair itself over time. Therefore, the aim of treatment is to prevent any further liver damage occurring. Post-Hepatic Jaundice: In most cases of post-hepatic jaundice, surgery is recommended to unblock the bile duct system.
