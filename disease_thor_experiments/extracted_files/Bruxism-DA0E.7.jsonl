#Causes - Bruxism - DA0E.7
The causes of Bruxism are not completely clear. There is no single factor that is responsible for bruxism. Multiple causative factors of bruxism are: Morphological factors, dental occlusion and the anatomy of the jaws may be associated with bruxism. Psychosocial factors: Stress, anxiety and certain personality characteristics. Special neurotransmitters. Patho-physiological factors such as diseases, trauma, genetics, smoking, alcoholism, caffeine intake, illicit drugs and medication. Sleep disorders (sleep apnoea and snoring).
#Diagnosis - Bruxism - DA0E.7
Bruxism is not a life-threatening disorder but it affects the quality of life by causing dental problems, such as tooth wear, tooth sensitivity, facial pain etc. Therefore, its early assessment is very essential. Methods to diagnose it are: Questionnaires used for both clinical and research purposes. Clinical examination of oral cavity looking for tooth surface wear, tooth mobility, tooth sensitivity, gum recession, discomfort and pain in jaw. Some of the methods of assessing bruxism are: Masticatory muscle Electromyographic recording (EMG).Polysomnographic (sleep laboratory) recordings for sleep bruxism generally include electroencephalogram, EMG, electrocardiogram and thermally sensitive resistor (monitoring air flow) signals along with simultaneous audio–video recordings.
#Prevention - Bruxism - DA0E.7
Identification of the problem is necessary to prevent it: If it is due to stress, focus on reducing it through relaxation, meditation, counselling etc, If it is due to a sleeping disorder; treatment of the sleeping disorder is a prerequisite, Reduce consumption of foods and drinks containing caffeine, Avoid chewing objects such as pen or pencils pins etc, Place your tongue between your teeth, if you notice yourself clenching or grinding during the day, Visit the dentist for proper diagnosis and treatment of the condition.
#Overview - Bruxism - DA0E.7
Habitual grinding or clenching of teeth, either during sleep or as an unconscious habit during waking hours, is known as Bruxism and commonly called as “Teeth Grinding”. Pavon described bruxism as one of the most common, complex and destructive dental functional disorder (parafunctional habit). Initially, it is difficult to identify mainly as the patients themselves are unaware of it. According to Nadler, bruxism affect a large percentage of the population, including all age groups. In some individuals it may be considered as an attempt to cope with stress and anxiety. Bruxism, usually, does not have any harmful effects but when it occurs on regular basis, it causes tooth wear, occlusal trauma, temporomandibular joint problems, and hypertrophy of muscles. Correct diagnosis is necessary for its treatment.
#Symptoms - Bruxism - DA0E.7
Bruxism causes sustained muscle contraction for long periods, reduces blood flow within the muscle tissues, creating the symptoms of fatigue, pain, and spasms. Bruxism symptoms includes: Effects on dentition, Effects on periodontium, Effects on masticatory muscles, Effects on temporomandibular joint, Head pain, Psychologic and behavioural effects.
#Treatment - Bruxism - DA0E.7
There is no specific treatment that can stop Sleep Bruxism. Treatments such as habit awareness therapy, habit reversal therapy, and relaxation techniques may eliminate Awake Bruxism. If the underlying cause of Bruxism is an emotional one, the nervous factor must be corrected if the disease is to be cured. Removable splints (occlusal splints, occlusal bite guard, night guards, bite plate , can  be worn at night to immobilise the jaws or to guide the movement so that periodontal damage is minimal.
