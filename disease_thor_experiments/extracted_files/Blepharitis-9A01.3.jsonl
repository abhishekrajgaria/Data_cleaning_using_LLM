#Causes - Blepharitis - 9A01.3
Exact aetiology of blepharitis is complex and not fully understood, though infection and inflammation contribute to the disease. Acute blepharitis is commonly due to chemical or allergic drug reaction. Chronic blepharitis may be associated with exposure to smoke, smog, chemical fumes or any other irritant. Specific causes of blepharitis include: Dry eye syndrome: Dry eye is reported to be present in staphylococcal blepharitis, and conversely, patients with dry eye develop staphylococcal blepharitis. Acne rosacea. Seborrhoeic dermatitis. Parasitic infestations, such as Demodex folliculorum (causes Demodicosis) and Phthiriasis palpebrarum.
#Complications - Blepharitis - 9A01.3
Complications of blepharitis may be: Conjunctivitis. Keratitis. Corneal infiltration. Corneal ulcer. Trichiasis. Eyelid notching. Entropion. Ectropion.
#Overview - Blepharitis - 9A01.3
Blepharitis is an inflammation of the eyelid margins. It is a common disorder affecting external eye, the cause for which is unclear, although seborrhoea and staphylococcal infection play important roles. Chronic blepharitis may cause secondary changes in the cornea and conjunctiva, and many patients have associated tear film instability. This condition may interfere with contact lens wear and aggravate treatment of dry eyes. While generally not sight- threatening, it may permanently damage eyelid margin.
#Diagnosis - Blepharitis - 9A01.3
Diagnosis depends upon the clinical presentation and examination of patient by an eye specialist. Examination of patients with blepharitis shows findings of associated systemic disease such as:- Acne rosacea: Rosacea is associated with pustules, telangiectasias, rhinophyma or erythema. Seborrhoeic dermatitis: Seborrhoeic dermatitis is characterised by oily skin and flaking from the scalp or eyebrows. Herpes simplex: Herpes simplex may show features of erythema and vesicle formation. Macroscopic examination of eyelids: Macroscopic gross examination of eyelids shows erythema and crusting of eyelashes and lid margins. Slit-lamp examination
#Symptoms - Blepharitis - 9A01.3
The symptoms of various types of blepharitis are similar, although there is frequently little correlation between their severity and the extent of clinical involvement. Many of the symptoms are secondary to tear film abnormality. Symptoms are frequently worse in the morning and are characterised by exacerbations and remissions. Symptoms of pure seborrhoeic blepharitis are similar but less severe than those of staphylococcal blepharitis, with less waxing and waning and fewer exacerbations. Common symptoms are:- Burning sensation in eyes. Foreign body sensation. Eye irritation. Watering of eyes. Pain in eyes. Itching. Erythema of lids. Crust formation on lid margins and medial canthus with matting of eyelashes. Redness of eyes. Mild photophobia. Blurred or decreased vision.
#Prevention - Blepharitis - 9A01.3
Maintenance of long-term regimen of eyelid hygiene helps in prevention of outbreaks and recurrent manifestations of systemic disease.
#Treatment - Blepharitis - 9A01.3
Management should be carried out under medical supervision. Blepharitis is a chronic condition for which therapy is directed to provide relief in patients who report discomfort or experience visual symptoms. Pathophysiology of anterior and posterior blepharitis may be different but the treatment options are similar. General measures: Eyelid hygiene: Eyelid hygiene includes warm compresses, eyelid massage and eyelid scrubs with wet washcloth and no tears baby shampoo, help to clear scales and debris. Medical therapy: Topical antibiotics: Topical antibiotics are useful to provide symptomatic relief and in eradicating bacteria from eyelid margin. Oral antibiotics: Oral antibiotics are recommended for patients with MGD not controlled with eyelid hygiene or patients with associated rosacea. Topical Steroids: Short courses of topical steroids provide symptomatic relief in cases with significant ocular inflammation. Topical combined antibiotic and steroid: Topical combination of antibiotic and steroid is useful in cases with coexistent bacterial infection and inflammation. Topical artificial tears: Many blepharitis patients have tear film abnormalities. Topical lubrication with artificial tears may improve symptoms when used as an adjunct to eyelid hygiene and medications. Topical cyclosporine: In patients with severe blepharitis, topical cyclosporine improve symptoms superior to combined antibiotic and steroid regimen. Surgical therapy: Surgical therapy for blepharitis is required only for complications such as trichiasis, chalazion, ectropion, entropion or corneal disease.
