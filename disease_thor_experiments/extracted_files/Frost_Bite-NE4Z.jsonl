#Causes - Frost Bite - NE4Z
Frostbite generally occurs when body is exposed to low temperatures. When the temperature is below freezing point, it leads to frostbite due to inadequate blood circulation to the exposed body parts. This can be due to the body's reaction to freezing by constricting circulation to the extremities so as to preserve its temperature and fight hypothermia. It can further lead to hypothermia (extreme cold, inadequate clothing, wet clothes, wind chill).  Poor circulation can also be due to other factors such as cramped positions, tight clothing, fatigue, certain medications, smoking, alcohol use, or diseases that affect the blood vessels such as diabetes.


#Diagnosis - Frost Bite - NE4Z
Frost bite is generally diagnosed based on the symptoms. Imaging Scans: MRI and X-rays can also be used to know the extent of severity in the frost bite. NHP provides indicative information for better understanding of health. For any diagnosis purpose you should consult your physician.
#Overview - Frost Bite - NE4Z
Frostbite is a medical condition involving damage to skin and tissues due to extreme cold. Frostbite is most likely to happen in body parts that are far from the heart or those with large exposed areas to cold weather. Frostbite can occur when skin is exposed to a temperature of 0 째C (32 째F) or lower, resulting in vasoconstriction. The resultant decrease in blood flow does not deliver sufficient heat to the tissue to prevent the formation of ice crystals.
#Prevention - Frost Bite - NE4Z
If there is high risk of frostbite for any length of time, clothing is very important. Make sure that extremities, such as hands, feet, nose, ears and lips, are well protected. These are the most vulnerable areas and often the first to be affected. Healthy warm meals and drinks, such as hot chocolate, are effective in keeping warmth.
#Symptoms - Frost Bite - NE4Z
At or below 0 째C (32 째F), blood vessels close to the skin start to constrict, and blood is shunted away from the extremities via the action of the glomus bodies (glomus bodies are most numerous in the fingers and toes. The glomus body has a high sympathetic tone and its potentiation leads to near complete vasoconstriction). There are four degrees of frostbite. Each of these degrees has varying degrees of pain. First degree: It is known as frost nip. It only affects the surface of   skin, which is exposed. Second degree:  If skin is exposed to cold for longer duration, then it may freeze and harden, but the deep tissues are generally not affected and remain soft and normal. Third and fourth degrees: If the exposed area freezes further, deep frostbite occurs. The muscles, tendons, blood vessels, and nerves all freeze.
#Treatment - Frost Bite - NE4Z
It is better to prevent from being exposed to cold by taking necessary precautions. Re-warming: It should be done only if that skin area will not be exposed to cold further. Ideally, re-warming should be done under medical supervision as: It can be a painful process that might require painkillers. The best results are achieved by using a whirlpool bath that contains a mild antiseptic. The affected area should be re-warmed slowly by immersing it in warm (not hot) water.
