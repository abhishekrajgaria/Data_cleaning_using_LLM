#Complications - Neonatal Respiratory Failure - KB2D
There is a significant risk that babies who experience neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (NRDS) may develop further problems: Air leaks, Internal bleeding, Bronchopulmonary dysplasia, Developmental disabilities.
#Causes - Neonatal Respiratory Failure - KB2D
It is caused by developmental deficiency of surfactant (slippery and protective substance) production and structural immaturity in the lungs. It can also result from a genetic problem with the production of surfactant associated proteins.
#Diagnosis - Neonatal Respiratory Failure - KB2D
These tests may include: Physical examination: To check for the distinctive signs and symptoms of NRDS. Blood tests: To measure the amount of oxygen in the blood and check for an infection. A pulse oximetry test: To measure how much oxygen is being absorbed in the blood, using a sensor attached to the fingertip, ear or toe. A chest X-ray: To look for the distinctive cloudy appearance of NRDS. An echocardiogram: A type of ultrasound scan that is used to create a picture of the inside of the heart.
#Overview - Neonatal Respiratory Failure - KB2D
It is also called as Infant respiratory distress syndrome (IRDS). It is a serious medical condition where a newborn baby's lungs cannot provide their body with enough oxygen. NRDS is also known as hyaline membrane disease, infant respiratory distress syndrome or newborn respiratory distress syndrome. IRDS begins shortly after birth and is manifest by tachypnea, tachycardia, chest wall retractions (recession), expiratory grunting, nasal flaring and cyanosis during breathing efforts.
#Treatment - Neonatal Respiratory Failure - KB2D
Babies that are born premature or are at high risk for the respiratory diseases, should be treated at birth by a medical team that specializes in newborn breathing problems. Artificial surfactant to an infant might be helpful. Infants should be given warm, moist oxygen. However, this treatment needs to be monitored carefully to avoid side effects from too much oxygen. A breathing machine is sometime used on the babies. Breathing machines can damage the lung tissue so use should be avoided when possible. Babies may need to use a breathing machine if they have: High levels of carbon dioxide in the arteries, Low blood oxygen in the arteries, Low blood pH (acidity), Repeated pauses in breathing.
#Symptoms - Neonatal Respiratory Failure - KB2D
Along with tachypnea and tachycardia There include: Bluish color of the skin and mucus membranes (cyanosis), Apnea, Decreased urine output, Grunting, Nasal flaring, Rapid breathing, Shallow breathing, Unusual breathing movement like drawing back of the chest muscles with breathing.
