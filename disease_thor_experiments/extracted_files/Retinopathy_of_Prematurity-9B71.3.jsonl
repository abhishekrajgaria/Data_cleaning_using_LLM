#Causes - Retinopathy of Prematurity - 9B71.3
Retinopathy of prematurity occurs in pre-term infants born before the normal growth of retinal blood vessels. Like other retinopathies, local ischaemia of retina plays a role in ROP. Excessive oxygen exposure causes obliteration of blood vessels in immature retina. Oxygen saturation maintained at lower level from birth can reduce the rate of advancement of ROP. Foetus in uterus is in hypoxic state as compared to life after birth. In pre-term infants, growth of retinal vessels is stimulated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). However, on exposure of immature retina to oxygen, the blood vessel constricts and can become obliterated resulting in delay of normal retinal vascular growth. This is the stage of hyperoxia-vasocessation. Initially, the retina derives oxygen by diffusion from the underlying capillary bed of choroidal layer. The retina continues to grow in thickness and outgrows its vascular supply. But over the time, avascular retina becomes ischaemic and stimulates VEGF leading to hypoxia-vasoproliferation stage and manifest as arterio-venous shunts and neovascularisation. Infants at risk are screened with appropriate timing of examination and follow up.
#Overview - Retinopathy of Prematurity - 9B71.3
Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), previously called retrolental fibroplasia, is a vaso-proliferative retinopathy which affects premature infants exposed to high concentration of oxygen. Retinopathy of prematurity often regresses but has the potential of causing visual impairment or blindness. ROP causes disorganised growth of retinal blood vessels which may lead to retinal scarring or even detachment of retina. Retina has no blood vessels until fourth month of gestation. Thereafter, vessels emanate from hyaloid vessels at the optic disc and progress towards periphery. These vessels reach nasal periphery after eight months of gestation, but do not reach temporal periphery until about one month after delivery. Incompletely vascularised temporal part of retina is particularly susceptible to damage with oxygen therapy, particularly in premature infants. Pre-term birth affects normal retinal vascular maturation. Exposure to oxygen down-regulate retinal vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), resulting in constriction/obliteration of blood vessels and delays normal retinal vascular development.
#Risk Factor - Retinopathy of Prematurity - 9B71.3
Risk factors for ROP: Gestational age (32 weeks or less). Low birth weight (Less than 1500 grams). Extended use of supplemental oxygen.
#Complications - Retinopathy of Prematurity - 9B71.3
Retinopathy of prematurity may lead to complications like:- Retinal detachment. Retinal breaks. Macular fold. Myopia. Strabismus. Amblyopia. Anisometropia. Nystagmus. Cataract.
#Diagnosis - Retinopathy of Prematurity - 9B71.3
Diagnosis depends on the history of development and the clinical features. Infants with lowest birth weights and youngest gestational ages are at increased risk of ROP. Prolonged exposure to supplemental oxygen is a risk factor contributing to ROP. Other predispositions with ROP are use of mechanical ventilation, patent ductus arteriosus, severity of associated illness (respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis or bronchopulmonary dysplasia). Clinical features: Active ROP: The severity of active ROP is assessed according to location, extent, stage and ‘plus’ disease. Location: Location of ROP is determined based on three zones with optic disc being at the center. Zone 1: It includes a circular area bounded by an imaginary circle, radius which is twice the distance from optic disc to macula. Zone 2: It includes an area extending from edge of zone 1 to a point tangential to Ora serrata (anterior limit of retina) and round to an area near equatorial temporal retina. Zone 3: This is the area consisting of residual temporal crescent lying anterior to zone 2.
#Prevention - Retinopathy of Prematurity - 9B71.3
Preventive considerations may be:- ROP is less likely to develop if neonate is more mature at birth. Maintaining oxygen saturation value at 83-93% by pulse oximeter in low birth weight premature infant, decreases the incidence of threshold ROP(http://reference.medscape.com/medline/abstract/17471328).
#Treatment - Retinopathy of Prematurity - 9B71.3
The infant should be managed under medical supervision. Ablative surgery is the mainstay of treatment. It is recommended for:- Zone 1 ROP: Any of the stage with ‘Plus’ disease. Zone 1 ROP: Stage 3 with no ‘Plus’ disease. Zone 2 ROP: Stage 2 or 3 with ‘Plus’ disease. Ablation of avascular immature retina: Cryotherapy (use of low temperatures): Cryotherapy produces a reduction in unfavourable outcomes in threshold   disease. Threshold disease is defined as five contiguous clock hours or eight non-contiguous clock hours of extra-retinal neovascularisation i.e. stage 3 disease in zone 1 or zone 2, associated with ‘Plus’ disease. It reduces the incidence of retinal detachment in many patients but some progress to retinal detachment in spite of treatment. Laser photocoagulation: Argon or Diode laser may be used to photocoagulate avascular areas of retina to reduce the incidence of complications. In spite of treatment, some patients still progress to develop complications like posterior pole macular fold or retinal detachment. Vitreoretinal surgery: Patients not responding to cryotherapy or laser photocoagulation may require vitreoretinal surgery to treat complications like retinal detachment.
