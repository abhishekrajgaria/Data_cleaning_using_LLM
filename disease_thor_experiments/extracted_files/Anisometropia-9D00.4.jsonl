#Diagnosis - Anisometropia - 9D00.4
Diagnosis depends upon retinoscopic examination in patients with defective visual acuity. Clinical types of Anisometropia: Anisometropia may be absolute or relative. I. Absolute anisometropia: In this condition, refractive power of the two eyes is not equal. This is further divided into Simple anisometropia, Compound anisometropia, Mixed anisometropia, Simple astigmatic anisometropia, Compound astigmatic anisometropia. II. Relative anisometropia: It is that refractive anomaly in which although the total refraction of the two eyes is nearly equal, the component elements in each show relatively large differences. Visual status in anisometropia: There are various visual possibilities Binocular single vision, Amblyopia, Alternating vision, Strabismus. Tests for binocular vision: Binocular vision may be assessed by using FRIEND test or Worth’s four-dot test. I. FRIEND test: In this test, alternate letters are green and red in colour. Letters F, I and N are in green colour and the letters R, E and D are in red colour. This is available in Snellen’s distance vision chart. Patient is seated 6 meters from the Snellen’s chart and wears diplopia goggles with red glass in front of the right eye and green glass in front of the left eye. Patient then reads letters FRIEND on Snellen’s chart. II. Worth’s four-dot test: Patient wears diplopia goggles with red glass in front of the right eye and green glass in front of the left eye. Patient views Snellen’s distance vision chart having four dots of light viz. one red, two green and one white.
#Causes - Anisometropia - 9D00.4
Anisometropia may be congenital or acquired. Congenital and developmental anisometropia: This is produced due to differential growth of each eyeball. It is hereditary in origin. Acquired anisometropia: This is produced by Post cataract surgery uniocular aphakia, Incorrect power of intraocular lens implant in patients of pseudophakia, Eye injury, Inadvertent surgical treatment of refractive error, Keratoplasty in one eye. 
#Symptoms - Anisometropia - 9D00.4
Anisometropia occurs because of uncorrected unequal refractive error between fellow eyes. Uncorrected anisometropia produces Accommodative asthenopia, Alternating vision, Blurring of image in one eye, Abnormal binocular interaction produced by dissimilar images on retina, Diplopia (double vision), Amblyopia (inability to see image from one eye), Strabismus (squint).
 
#Overview - Anisometropia - 9D00.4
Anisometropia is an optical state with unequal refraction of the two eyes. The amount of spherical refractive error (myopia or hypermetropia) is usually about the same for both the eyes in most of the people. Generally, anisometropia is considered to exist if the refraction differs by 1.0 dioptres (D) or more for the two eyes. The measuring unit for refractive error is dioptre (D), which is defined as the reciprocal of the focal length in meters. Anisometropia is the most insidious refractive condition because it is often asymptomatic. The term antimetropia is used when one eye is myopic and the other is hypermetropic. Anisometropia due to refractive myopia or hypermetropia is known as refractive anisometropia and that due to axial ametropia is known as axial anisometropia. Anisometropia due to difference in refractive error along one meridian only is called meridional anisometropia.
#Treatment - Anisometropia - 9D00.4
Medical therapy: Principal factors which influence optical correction of anisometropia are aniseikonia and amblyopia. Medical therapy includes: Spectacles: The corrective glasses may be tolerated up to a maximum difference of 4 D in two eyes. A difference more than 4 D produces diplopia. In children younger than 12 years of age, where best visual correction is required in both the eyes, contact lenses are preferred. In adults, best correction may be prescribed which does not result in ocular discomfort. Contact lenses: Contact lenses are advised for higher degrees of anisometropia. These are more useful in young children with high anisometropia, who may become amblyopic in more ametropic eye. Surgical therapy: This is the preferred mode of treatment. Surgical therapy includes: Intraocular lens implantation, Refractive corneal surgery, Removal of crystalline lens, Phakic IOL, Clear lens extraction with the implantation of an IOL.
