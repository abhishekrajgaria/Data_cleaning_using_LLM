#Complication - Giant Papillary Conjunctivitis - 9A60.00
GPC may lead to Ptosis.
#Causes - Giant Papillary Conjunctivitis - 9A60.00
The antigens responsible for giant papillary conjunctivitis are not yet identified. The initiating event is believed to be antigenic stimulus and/or mechanical irritation of the upper palpebral (lid) conjunctiva, perhaps by a contact lens surface or edge or deposit, followed by histological changes in the tissue (mast cell de-granulation and secondary inflammatory cascade). Debris on the surface of contact lenses may be a cause as well as a result, leading to inflammation that causes more lens deposits to form, leading to further inflammation. First-generation silicone hydro-gel contact lenses may be more prone to GPC development, perhaps because of their mechanical stiffness or higher propensity for lipid deposition.
#Diagnosis - Giant Papillary Conjunctivitis - 9A60.00
Diagnosis of GPC is generally made by thorough history and careful clinical observation. A careful and selective history is necessary to elicit the reports of symptoms that many may consider normal discomfort associated with contact lens use. A history of systemic allergy also help to predict which of the contact lens users may end up with GPC. Slit-lamp (bio-microscopic) examination by an eye-specialist is required for the diagnosis. GPC should be differentiated from conditions such as: Allergic conjunctivitis. Viral conjunctivitis. Bacterial conjunctivitis. Chlamydial genitourinary infections. Congenital ptosis.
#Overview - Giant Papillary Conjunctivitis - 9A60.00
Giant (mechanically induced) Papillary Conjunctivitis (GPC), the severe form of mechanically induced papillary conjunctivitis, may be secondary to a variety of mechanical stimuli of the tarsal conjunctiva. GPC is most often associated with wearing soft (hydro-gel) contact lenses, though it can occur with any type of contact lens. Silicone hydro-gel lenses also appear to have similar effects with prolonged use. Incidence among extended wearers is supposed to be higher than the daily wearers of soft lenses.
#Prevention - Giant Papillary Conjunctivitis - 9A60.00
Preventive methods adopted to reduce the prevalence of GPC among users of hydro-gel contact lenses are: Increased frequency of contact lens replacement. Decreased wear time. Hydrogen peroxide disinfection. Timely appropriate professional supervision. Rigorous cleaning measures (particularly with enzyme tablets).
#Symptoms - Giant Papillary Conjunctivitis - 9A60.00
GPC patients may have variety of symptoms in eye, such as: Redness. Burning sensation. Itching. Irritation. Foreign body sensation. Increased mucus secretion, particularly on awakening in the morning (especially at the inner canthus). Decreased contact lens tolerance. Excessive contact lens movement. Blurring of vision. Ptosis (drooping of upper eyelid). Bloody tears (very rare).
#Treatment - Giant Papillary Conjunctivitis - 9A60.00
Treatment should be carried out under medical supervision. Medical therapy: Medications such as mast cell stabilisers and topical corticosteroids may be needed to control immune reaction. Drug therapy includes: Topical artificial tears, Topical combined vasoconstrictor and antihistamine, Topical mast cell stabilisers, Topical selective second-generation H1-blocking antihistamines, Selective H1-blocking antihistamines and topical mast cell stabilisers (Dual acting drugs), Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), Topical corticosteroids, Immune-modulator drugs. Surgical therapy: Refractive surgery: Refractive surgery such as laser-assisted in-situ keratomileusis (LASIK) may be considered in patients who refuse conservative management. Prognosis: Overall prognosis of giant papillary conjunctivitis is good.
