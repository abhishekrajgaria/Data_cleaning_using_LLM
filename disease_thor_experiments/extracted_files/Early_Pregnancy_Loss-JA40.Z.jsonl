#Causes - Early Pregnancy Loss - JA40.Z
In most of the cases of early pregnancy loss, cause of spontaneous abortion is not known; approximately 50% of all cases of early pregnancy loss are due to fetal chromosomal abnormalities. Other causes include: Autoimmune disorders, Uterine abnormalities, Problems of placenta, Having two or more  previous spontaneous abortions, Being 35 years or older, Having certain prenatal tests like amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling, Too much caffeine during pregnancy, Obesity.
#Diagnosis - Early Pregnancy Loss - JA40.Z
A thorough evaluation is needed to make a definitive diagnosis as common symptoms of early pregnancy loss, such as vaginal bleeding and pain in lower abdomen, also are common in normal pregnancy, ectopic pregnancy and molar pregnancy. Hemoglobin estimation: It is done to evaluate anemia. Urine pregnancy test: It is used to confirm pregnancy state. Serum human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) testing: Serial quantitative blood tests are used to determine the viability of a pregnancy. Blood group and Rh typing are done, if these are not already known. Rh typing is used to plan for administration of anti- Rh D immunoglobulin in Rh-negative woman.

#Overview - Early Pregnancy Loss - JA40.Z
Early pregnancy loss is non-induced embryonic or fetal death or passage of products of conception before 20 weeks gestation. Early pregnancy loss is also termed as spontaneous abortion or miscarriage. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines it as expulsion or extraction of an embryo or fetus weighing 500 g or less. Spontaneous abortion in the first trimester is common, affecting at least 15–20% of the clinically recognized pregnancies. Approximately 80% of all cases of pregnancy loss occur within the first three months of pregnancy (first trimester).
#Treatment - Early Pregnancy Loss - JA40.Z
Management  depends on the stage of spontaneous abortion. Threatened abortion: No medications such as hormones (e.g. estrogens or progestins) or tocolytic agents are helpful as they will not prevent abortion. Inevitable and incomplete abortion: During and after the miscarriage the aim is to prevent the haemorrhage and infection. Expectant management: After discussing all treatment options (expectant, medical, and surgical management) with the woman to allow her to make an informed choice. Medical management: For patients who prefer to avoid surgical evacuation, medical management of early pregnancy loss can be advised with the proper counseling about bleeding, pain and that surgery may be needed if medical management does not achieve complete expulsion. Surgical management: For inevitable, incomplete, or missed abortions, treatment is uterine evacuation. Rh-immunoglobulin: Women who are Rh negative and unsensitized should receive 50 micrograms of  Rh (D): immunoglobulin immediately after surgical management of early pregnancy loss or within 72 hours of the diagnosis of early pregnancy loss with planned medical management or expectant management in the first trimester.
#Symptoms - Early Pregnancy Loss - JA40.Z
