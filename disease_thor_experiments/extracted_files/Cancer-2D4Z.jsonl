#Diagnosis - Cancer - 2D4Z
Cancers can generally be recognized by appearance of signs and symptoms through screening. Screening: Screening tests help in detecting cancer at an early stage (before the symptoms appear). When abnormal tissue or cancer is found early, it is easy to treat or cure. By the time symptoms appear, the cancer might have grown and spread. This can make the cancer harder to treat or cure. It is important to remember that when a doctor suggests any screening test, it does not always mean  that there is a  cancer. People with suspected cancer are investigated with medical tests. These tests include Blood tests, X-rays, MRIs, Biopsy, Pap-smears, CT scans and Endoscopy and many more.
#Causes - Cancer - 2D4Z
Various causes of cancer are: Genetic mutations, Harmful rays due to exposure to sun/ radiation, Diet and physical activity, Hereditary, Environmental factors, Idiopathic/unknown.
#Overview - Cancer - 2D4Z
Cancer is a group of diseases characterized by uncontrolled cell division that leads to abnormal tissue growth. Many a times, people often use the terms cancer and tumor synonymously. But all tumours are not cancerous. There are two main types of tumors: malignant tumours and benign tumours. Malignant tumours: These are the cancerous cells that can invade and destroy surrounding healthy tissue, including organs. The cancer can spread to distant parts of the body through the lymphatic system or bloodstream. Not all tumours are cancerous. Benign tumours:  These types of tumours do not grow uncontrollably or do not invade neighboring tissues. They do not spread throughout the body.
#Symptoms - Cancer - 2D4Z
Symptoms of cancer, are usually caused by the effect of cancer on the part of body where it is growing. Although symptoms of cancer may appear in the form of general debility including weight loss or tiredness, yet it is generally advised that if anyone is experiencing unusual symptoms for more than a few weeks than he/she should seek medical attention. General symptoms occur due to distant effects of the cancer that are not related to direct or metastatic spread. These may include: Unintentional weight loss, Fever, Getting extremely tired easily (Fatigue), Changes in the skin color/ appearance.
#Treatment - Cancer - 2D4Z
Remedial treatment: Remedial treatment refers to treatment which seeks to make the patient feel better and may or may not be combined with an attempt to attack the cancer. Surgery: Surgery is the fundamental method of treatment of most isolated cancers and may play a role in remedial measure and prolongation of survival. Biopsy is normally required. Radiation: Radiation therapy involves the use of ionizing radiation in an attempt to either cure or ameliorate the symptoms of cancer. Chemotherapy: Chemotherapy in addition to surgery has proven to be useful in a number of different cancer types including: breast cancer, colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, osteogenic sarcoma, testicular cancer, ovarian cancer, and some lung cancers.
