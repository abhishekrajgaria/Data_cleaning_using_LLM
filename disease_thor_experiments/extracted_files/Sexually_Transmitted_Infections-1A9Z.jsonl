#Causes - Sexually Transmitted Infections - 1A9Z
STIs are caused by more than 30 different bacteria, viruses and parasites. The major STIs and their causes are: Bacteria-Chlamydia trachomatis (disease-Chlamydia), neisseria gonorrhoeae (disease-Gonorrhea)  and Treponema pallidum (disease-Syphilis); Viruses- Human immunodeficiency virus(HIV/AIDS), herpes simplex virus (HSV) (disease- Genital herpes), human papilloma virus (HPV)(disease- Genital warts), hepatitis B virus (disease-Hepatitis), and cytomegalovirus; yeasts and protozoan parasites-Trichomonas vaginalis (disease-Trichomoniasis) , pubic lice (disease- Pediculosis pubis), Sarcoptes scabiei (disease-scabies).
#Diagnosis - Sexually Transmitted Infections - 1A9Z
Accurate diagnostic tests for STIs are widely used in high-income countries. These are especially useful for the diagnosis of asymptomatic infections. However, in low- and middle-income countries, diagnostic tests are largely unavailable. Where testing is available, it is often expensive and geographically inaccessible; and patients often need to wait a long time (or need to return) to receive results. The only inexpensive, rapid blood test currently available for an STI is for syphilis. This test is already used in testing of syphilis in pregnant women during antenatal care.
#Riskfactor - Sexually Transmitted Infections - 1A9Z
Biological factors: Age- women become infected at a younger age than men. Sex- women can be more easily infected than men. Behavioural factors: changing sexual partners frequently; having more than one sexual partner; having sex with casual partners, sex workers or their clients; having unprotected  sex when either partner has an infection; having had an STI in the last year. Social factors: A number of social factors link sex and behavioural issues and may affect a person’s risk of getting an STI. Population groups which are particularly vulnerable: sexually active teenage girls; sex workers and their clients; Men having sex with men including transgender; Street children, prison inmates.
#Treatment - Sexually Transmitted Infections - 1A9Z
Syndromic Treatment: WHO has recommended syndromic management, which is based on the identification of consistent groups of symptoms and easily recognized signs (syndromes) to guide treatment, without the use of laboratory tests. Education and Counselling: Counselling is defined here as an interactive confidential process in which a care provider helps a patient to discuss on issues associated with STIs and to explore possible lines of action. Manage and treat partner: Management of sexual partners is based on knowledge of the index patient’s diagnosis (syndromic or specific). Offer HIV Counselling and testing: A consultation for an STI is a unique opportunity to provide education on the prevention of HIV and STIs to people who, by definition, are at risk for these infections. Follow up: Appropriate clinical follow up is a part of comprehensive case management of STI.
#Complication - Sexually Transmitted Infections - 1A9Z
STIs can have serious consequences not only on physical health, but also on the psychological and social well-being of those infected.  If STIs were left untreated, both chlamydia and gonorrhoea can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) in females, which can cause infertility and ectopic pregnancies. Gonococcal and chlamydial infection can cause epididymitis and infertility in men. Mother-to-child transmission of STIs during pregnancy and childbirth can result in stillbirth, neonatal death, low-birth-weight and prematurity, sepsis, pneumonia, neonatal conjunctivitis, and congenital deformities. HPV infection causes cervical cancer. Infection with STIs can also increase the risk of acquiring infection with HIV. Multi-drug resistant gonorrhea-Infections with antibiotic-resistant strains of gonorrhoea are becoming increasingly common.
#Overview - Sexually Transmitted Infections - 1A9Z
Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are infections that spread primarily through person-to-person sexual contact. STIs are of public health concern not only because of their high prevalence worldwide, but also because of their potential to cause serious and permanent complications in infected people who are not treated in a timely and effective way. These complications and sequelae include infertility, fetal wastage, ectopic pregnancy, anogenital cancer and premature death, as well as neonatal and infant infections. In addition STIs are known to facilitate human immunodeficiency virus infection/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS).
#Prevention - Sexually Transmitted Infections - 1A9Z
Primary prevention or preventing infection in uninfected persons: This is the most effective strategy to reduce the spread of STI and can be easily integrated in all health care settings. Secondary prevention: This prevents further transmission of that infection in the community and prevents complications and reinfection in the patient. Counseling and behavioural approaches: Counseling and behavioural interventions offer primary prevention against STIs (including HIV). Barrier methods: Use of barrier methods as condoms offers one of the most effective methods of protection against STIs, including HIV. Vaccines: Safe and highly effective vaccines are available for two STIs: hepatitis B and human papilloma virus (HPV). Other biomedical interventions to prevent some STIs include adult male circumcision and microbicides.
#Symptoms - Sexually Transmitted Infections - 1A9Z
The majority of STIs are present without symptoms. A person can have an STI without having obvious symptoms of disease. Common symptoms of STDs include: Unusual discharge from the penis or vagina, Sores or warts on the genital area, Painful or frequent urination, Itching and redness in the genital area, Blisters or sores in or around the mouth, Abnormal vaginal odour, Anal itching, soreness, or bleeding, Dysparuenia, Abdominal pain, Fever.
