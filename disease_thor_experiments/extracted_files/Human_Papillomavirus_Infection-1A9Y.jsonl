#Complication - Human Papillomavirus Infection - 1A9Y
Complications of HPV infection: cervical cancer, other anogenital cancers( anus, vulva, vagina and penis), head and neck cancers, recurrent juvenile respiratory papillomatosis, genital warts.
#Diagnosis - Human Papillomavirus Infection - 1A9Y
Most of the HPV infections and cervical cancer in its early stage show no clinical signs and symptoms; precancerous lesions and early cancers can be detected by screening tests. Screening for cervical cancer: There are 3 different types of screening tests: Conventional (Pap) test and liquid-based cytology (LBC) - The Pap test is used to detect abnormal cells that may develop into cancer if left untreated. Visual inspection with Acetic Acid (VIA) - Doctor may apply a dilute acetic acid solution (vinegar solution) to the cervix, which causes abnormal areas to turn white. HPV testing for high-risk HPV type- HPV testing is used to look for the presence of high-risk HPV types in cervical cells.
#Prevention - Human Papillomavirus Infection - 1A9Y
Cervical cancer prevention and control: A comprehensive approach: WHO recommends a comprehensive approach to cervical cancer prevention and control. Primary prevention begins with HPV vaccination of girls aged 9-13 years, before they become sexually active. Two HPV vaccines are there - a bivalent and a quadrivalent vaccine. Other preventive interventions may be recommended to boys and girls as appropriate are: education about safe sexual practices, including delayed start of sexual activity; promotion and provision of condoms for those already engaged in sexual activity; warnings about tobacco use, which often starts during adolescence, and which is an important risk factor for cervical and other cancers; and male circumcision. Secondary prevention:  It includes Screening (early diagnosis) and treatment.
#Overview - Human Papillomavirus Infection - 1A9Y
Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a group of viruses that is common throughout the world. HPV is transmitted through sexual contact and is the most common viral infection of the reproductive tract. The main burden of HPV-related disease is due to cervical cancer. HPV infection is a well-established cause of cervical cancer and a relevant factor in other anogenital cancers (anus, vulva, vagina and penis) and head and neck cancers.
#Riskfactor - Human Papillomavirus Infection - 1A9Y
Risk factors for HPV persistence and development of cervical cancer: Early first sexual intercourse, Multiple sexual partners, High parity, Long-term use of hormonal contraceptives, Tobacco use, Immune suppression (for example, HIV-infected individuals are at higher risk of HPV infection and are infected by a broader range of HPV types), Low socioeconomic status, poor hygiene and diet low in antioxidants, Co-infection with Chlamydia trachomatis and Herpes simplex virus type-2.
#Symptoms - Human Papillomavirus Infection - 1A9Y
Symptoms may be: irregular, intermenstrual (between periods) or abnormal vaginal bleeding after sexual intercourse or  bleeding after menopause; vaginal discomfort or odourous discharge from vagina, the discharge may contain some blood and may occur between periods or after menopause; Pain during sex; back, leg or pelvic pain; fatigue, weight loss, loss of appetite; a single swollen leg.
#Treatment - Human Papillomavirus Infection - 1A9Y
If abnormal cells or lesions detected during screening tests, treatment is needed to excise abnormal cells or lesions. It includes cryotherapy (destroying abnormal tissue on the cervix by freezing it) or Loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) when the patient is not eligible for cryotherapy. If signs of cervical cancer are present, treatment options for invasive cancer include surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy.
