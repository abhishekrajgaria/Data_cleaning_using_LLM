#Complications - Toxic conjunctivitis - 9A60.2
Toxic keratoconjunctivitis is usually does not affect sight. Potential complications of severe toxic keratoconjunctivitis may be: Corneal necrosis. Persistent corneal epithelial defects. Corneal ulcer. Corneal perforation.
#Overview - Toxic conjunctivitis - 9A60.2
Toxic keratoconjunctivitis or Toxic conjunctivitis may result from topical preparations for the treatment of ophthalmic conditions. Topical ophthalmic preparations can confuse the diagnosis of toxic keratoconjunctivitis. Medications often alleviate the symptoms initially and only at a later time, sometimes years after initiating therapy, will the patient develop discomfort. Common toxic agents are glaucoma medications, preservatives, antibiotics and antivirals. Patients with keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eye syndrome) are particularly at risk.
#Prevention - Toxic conjunctivitis - 9A60.2
For prevention: Patients should avoid routine use of over-the-counter (OTC) eye preparations, such as artificial tears or vasoconstrictors. If necessary, these should be used less frequently and for shorter duration. Topical preservative-free formulations for the eye should be used, whenever possible, to prevent preservative related toxic keratoconjunctivitis. Contact lens wear, if required, should be used cautiously, since they can act as a toxic reservoir.
#Treatment - Toxic conjunctivitis - 9A60.2
Management of Toxic keratoconjunctivitis depends on the time of exposure and severity of the ocular surface disease. General measures: Discontinuation of the offending toxic agent: Primary therapeutic strategy is the discontinuation of the offending toxic agent. Attempts should be made to stop medications or to substitute them with less toxic or preservative-free formulations. Contact lens wear, if required, should be used cautiously, since they can act as a toxic reservoir. Cold compresses: Cold compresses may be soothing and may help in ocular irritation. Medical therapy: Preservative free artificial tears: For mild disease, a preservative free artificial tear may be used for symptomatic relief. Topical corticosteroids: Topical corticosteroids may be needed for more symptomatic patients. Surgical therapy: Patients may require surgical measures, for complications and sequlae, such as: Tarsorrhaphy: Tarsorrhaphy may be required for persistent corneal epithelial defects. Conjunctival flap: Conjunctival flap is an alternative for persistent epithelial defects of cornea. Amniotic membrane grafting: Amniotic membrane grafting may be beneficial in covering epithelial defects, thereby promoting corneal healing. Keratoplasty: Keratoplasty may be required for impending corneal perforation or necrosis.
#Causes - Toxic conjunctivitis - 9A60.2
There is no single mechanism responsible for drug intolerance or toxicity, but a combination of these occurs simultaneously, or in sequence and cause symptoms. Direct toxic effects: Medications can be directly toxic to the conjunctival and corneal epithelium, damaging its structure and altering its function with or without an inflammatory response. Some preparations are directly toxic due to change in pH, osmolarity of solution, or due to photosensitisation. Direct toxic effects usually occur after the first contact and appear after a threshold is reached. The cellular reaction may reflect the direct effect due to Active compound. Accompanying preservative. Breakdown products.
#Diagnosis - Toxic conjunctivitis - 9A60.2
Diagnostic tests: Most tests are not practical or not widely available and are difficult to perform in the clinical set up. Conjunctival Scraping: The presence of eosinophils and basophils on conjunctival scrapings points to an allergic reaction but it is relatively non-specific, since these cells can also be found in toxic keratoconjunctivitis. In clinical setting, this test is most often used to rule out infectious disease and allergy. Conjunctival Biopsy: Conjunctival biopsies are reserved for confirmation or exclusion of autoimmune diseases and are usually reserved for the diagnosis of cicatrising conjunctivitis (e.g. pemphigoid). Patients, after long-term glaucoma treatment, may show squamous metaplasia of the conjunctival epithelium and sub-conjunctival inflammation and fibrosis. Impression Cytology: Impression Cytology provides a homogeneous cell layer for histological studies. Epithelial cells, goblet cells and inflammatory cells can be differentiated with immune-staining and can even be used for flow cytometry analysis, which allows measurement of membrane and cytoplasmic inflammatory markers. Tear analysis: Tear samples can be used to measure levels of IgE or inflammatory cytokines, though they are rarely used except for research purposes.
#Symptoms - Toxic conjunctivitis - 9A60.2
Toxic keratoconjunctivitis may produce symptoms such as: Eyelids and Periorbital skin: Oedema. Itching (pruritus). Urticaria. Dermatitis. Conjunctiva: Redness. Mucoid discharge. Chemosis. Itching. Cornea: Photophobia (sensitivity to light). Corneal lesions, such as ulcers.
