#Diagnosis - Hypertension - BA00.Z
All adults should know their blood pressure levels. There are different types of devices (sphygmomanometers) that are used to measure blood pressure. These are electronic, mercury and aneroid devices. Routine laboratory tests are also recommended before initiating therapy. These include an electrocardiogram; urine analysis; blood glucose and hematocrit; serum potassium, creatinine (or the corresponding estimated glomerular filtration rate [GFR]), calcium; and a lipid profile after 9 to12 hour fast that includes high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides.
#Overview - Hypertension - BA00.Z
Hypertension Hypertension, also known as high or raised blood pressure, is a condition in which the blood vessels have persistently raised pressure. Blood is carried from the heart to all parts of the body in the vessels. Each time the heart beats, it pumps blood into the vessels. Blood pressure is created by the force of blood pushing against the walls of blood vessels (arteries) as it is pumped by the heart. The higher the pressure in blood vessels the harder the heart has to work in order to pump blood. If left uncontrolled, hypertension can lead to a heart attack, an enlargement of the heart and eventually heart failure. Blood vessels may develop bulges (aneurysms) and weak spots due to high pressure, making them more likely to clog and burst. The pressure in the blood vessels can also cause blood to leak out into the brain. This can cause a stroke. Hypertension can also lead to kidney failure, blindness, rupture of blood vessels and cognitive impairment.
#Prevention - Hypertension - BA00.Z
Primary prevention- Everyone can take five concrete steps to minimize the chances of developing high blood pressure and its adverse consequences. This is termed as primary prevention. It includes- 1. Healthy diet: promoting a healthy lifestyle with emphasis on proper nutrition for infants and young people; reducing salt intake to less than 5 g of salt per day (just under a teaspoon); eating five servings of fruit and vegetables a day; reducing saturated and trans fats and total fat intake. 2. Avoiding harmful use of alcohol i.e. limit intake to no more than one standard drink a day 3. Physical activity: Regular physical activity and promotion of physical activity for children and young people (at least 30 minutes a day five times a week). Maintaining a normal body weight: every 5 kg of excess weight lost can reduce systolic blood pressure by 2 to 10 points. 4. Stopping tobacco use and exposure to tobacco products. 5. Managing stress in healthy ways such as through meditation, appropriate physical exercise, and positive social contact. Secondary prevention-The goal of secondary prevention is to detect and control high blood pressure in affected individual, thereby reducing the risk of complications.
#Symptoms - Hypertension - BA00.Z
Most hypertensive people have no symptoms at all; this is why it is known as the “silent killer”. Sometimes hypertension causes symptoms such as headache, shortness of breath, dizziness, chest pain, palpitations of the heart and nose bleeds. It can be dangerous to ignore such symptoms, but neither can they be relied upon to signify hypertension. Hypertension is a serious warning sign that significant lifestyle changes are required.
#Treatment - Hypertension - BA00.Z
Antihypertensive Medicines- Antihypertensive drugs (drugs lowering the BP) work in several ways, such as removing excess salt and fluid from the body, slowing the heartbeat or relaxing and widening the blood vessels. Medicines to lower blood pressure include: Diuretics (Water or Fluid Pills): Flush excess sodium from the body, which reduces the amount of fluid in blood and helps to lower your blood pressure. Beta Blockers: Help heart to beat slower and with less force. As a result, heart pumps less blood through blood vessels, which can help to lower blood pressure. Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitors: Angiotensin-II is a hormone that narrows blood vessels, increasing blood pressure. ACE converts Angiotensin I to Angiotensin II. ACE inhibitors block this process, which stops the production of Angiotensin II, lowering blood pressure. Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers (ARBs): Block angiotensin II hormone from binding with receptors in the blood vessels. When angiotensin II is blocked, the blood vessels do not constrict or narrow, which can lower your blood pressure. Calcium Channel Blockers: Keep calcium from entering the muscle cells of heart and blood vessels. This allows blood vessels to relax, which can lower blood pressure. Alpha Blockers: Reduce nerve impulses that tighten blood vessels. This allows blood to flow more freely, causing blood pressure to go down. Alpha-Beta Blockers: Reduce nerve impulses and also slow the heartbeat. As a result, blood pressure goes down. Central Acting Agents: Act in the brain to decrease nerve signals that narrow blood vessels, which can lower blood pressure. Vasodilators: Relax the muscles in blood vessel walls, which can lower blood pressure.
#Causes - Hypertension - BA00.Z
Hypertension is divided into primary (essential) and secondary hypertension. Primary or essential hypertension-When the underlying cause cannot be determined, this type of high blood pressure is called "essential hypertension”. It accounts for 90-95% of adult cases of hypertension. It has been linked to certain risk factors. It may develop as a result of environmental or genetic causes. Obesity, diabetes, and heart disease also have genetic components and contribute to hypertension. Secondary hypertension-When a direct cause for high blood pressure can be identified, the condition is described as secondary hypertension. About 2-10% of high blood pressure cases are due to an underlying condition or cause such as- Renal parenchymal diseases (2.5-6%), Vascular causes (.2-4%), Endocrine causes (1-2%) Exogenous (administration of steroids, oral contraceptive use), Endogenous (primary hyperaldosteronism, cushing syndrome, pheochromocytoma, congenital adrenal hyperplasia), drugs and toxins (alcohol, cocaine, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs(NSAID), nicotine, decongestant containing ephedrine, herbal remedies containing licorice or ephedrine). Other causes include pregnancy induced hypertension, Obstructive sleep apnea.
#Complications - Hypertension - BA00.Z
When blood pressure stays high over long time, it can damage the different organs of the body and causes complications. Some common complications include: Heart: left ventricular hypertrophy, angina/previous myocardial infarction, and heart failure. Brain: stroke or transient ischemic attack, dementia. Chronic kidney disease. Peripheral arterial disease, aneurysms. Retinopathy. Cognitive changes.
