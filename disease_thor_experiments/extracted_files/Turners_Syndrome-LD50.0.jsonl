#Causes - Turners Syndrome - LD50.0
Turner syndrome is a genetic condition caused by abnormal sex chromosomes. It only affects females who have a missing or incomplete X chromosome.
#Diagnosis - Turners Syndrome - LD50.0
Pre-natal tests: Turner syndrome may be diagnosed by amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling during pregnancy. Postnatal: Turner syndrome can be diagnosed post natally at any age. Often, it is diagnosed at birth because of heart problems, an unusually wide neck or swelling of the hands and feet. A test, called a karyotype or a chromosome analysis, analyzes the chromosomal composition of the individual. This is the test of choice to diagnose Turner syndrome.
#Symptoms - Turners Syndrome - LD50.0
Symptom Includes: Short stature, Lymphodema (swelling) of the hands and feet, Broad chest (shield chest) and widely spaced nipples, Low hairline, Low-set ears, Reproductive sterility, Rudimentary ovaries, Amenorrhoea, or the absence of a menstrual period, Increased weight, obesity, Shield shaped thorax of heart, Small fingernails, Characteristic facial features, Coarctation of the aorta, Bicuspid aortic valve.
#Overview - Turners Syndrome - LD50.0
Turner syndrome is a genetic condition that only affects females. It is a chromosomal abnormality in which all or part of one of the sex chromosomes is absent or has other abnormalities (unaffected humans have 46 chromosomes, of which two are sex chromosomes). In some cases, the chromosome is missing in some cells but not others, a condition referred to as mosaicism or Turner mosaicism.
#Treatment - Turners Syndrome - LD50.0
There is no cure for Turner syndrome, but many of the associated symptoms like short stature, sexual development problems and learning difficulties, can be treated. Oestrogen replacement therapy such as birth control pill, has been used to promote development of secondary sexual characteristics. Modern reproductive technologies have also been used. For example, a donor egg can be used to create an embryo, which is carried by the Turner syndrome woman.
