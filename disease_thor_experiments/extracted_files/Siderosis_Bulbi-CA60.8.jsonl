#Causes - Siderosis Bulbi - CA60.8
Retained intraocular foreign body are common in open globe injuries, causing multitude of adverse problems, many of them leading to severe visual disability. Iron can ionise and diffuse throughout the eye, and then is deposited mainly as ferritin, and sometimes as cytoplasmic siderosomes, in many ocular structures. Toxicity to essential enzyme processes due to excess of intracellular free iron leads to trabecular meshwork scarring, secondary chronic open angle glaucoma, anterior sub capsular cataract (siderosis lentis), and neural retinal degeneration.
#Diagnosis - Siderosis Bulbi - CA60.8
Diagnosis depends upon clinical history and examination. Histopathology: Histopathologically, siderosis is characterised by accumulation of iron within metabolically active cells. Haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and periodic acid- Schiff (PAS) staining: In H&E and PAS stained sections, iron may resemble melanin granules , although they are usually somewhat lighter in colour, more irregular in structure, and slightly larger. Prussian blue staining: Iron particles are best demonstrated by Prussian blue staining, in which the iron granules stain deep blue, in contrast to melanin, which does not take up stain.
#Prevention - Siderosis Bulbi - CA60.8
Prevention may minimise sight- threatening effect of siderosis. Awareness regarding protection against ocular injuries related to dangerous work should be stressed. Appropriate measures for protection of eyes should be encouraged.
#Treatment - Siderosis Bulbi - CA60.8
Treatment entails removal of retained IOFB. Removal of IOFB may stop the progression of siderosis. Early surgical removal of metallic IOFB is recommended for good visual prognosis. It may be done through limbal incision or by using intraocular forceps with a pars plana vitrectomy. Prognosis: The visual prognosis for siderosis is fairly good in some cases. However, removal of intraocular iron is advocated, wherever possible.
#Complication - Siderosis Bulbi - CA60.8
Complications may be: Cataract. Retinal pigmentary degeneration. Iris heterochromia. Pupillary mydriasis. Secondary glaucoma. Relative afferent pupillary defect. Retinal detachment. Depressed electroretinogram.
#Overview - Siderosis Bulbi - CA60.8
Siderosis Bulbi is a degenerative and pigmentary change in the eye that follows intra- ocular retention of a foreign body containing iron. Its degree of severity and rate of development depend upon the content and location of iron. Large, more posteriorly situated, and ferrous intra-ocular foreign bodies have the worst prognosis. Histopathologically, siderosis shows accumulation of iron within metabolically active cells. Cells of corneal epithelium, pupillary constrictor muscle, lens epithelium, trabecular meshwork, pars plana and retinal pigment epithelium all may be affected.
#Symptoms - Siderosis Bulbi - CA60.8
Symptoms of Siderosis may include: Diminution of vision. Dilated pupil (It is an early feature). Night blindness (It is an early symptom). Heterochromia (affected side is darker in colour). Yellow- brown cataract.
