#Complications - Salzmanns Nodular Degeneration - 9A78.4
Complications of Salzmann’s nodular degeneration: Irritation of ocular surface, Hypermetropic (hyperopic) visual changes, Astigmatism, Peripheral corneal vascularisation.
#Causes - Salzmanns Nodular Degeneration - 9A78.4
Though the aetiology remains uncertain in majority of the cases, it is hypothesized that Salzmann’s nodular degeneration can be triggered by multiple events that lead to a nonspecific corneal tissue reaction based on individual predisposition. Ocular surface disorders: Meibomian gland dysfunction, Phlyctenular keratitis, Dry eye disease, Rosacea keratitis, Vernal keratoconjunctivitis, Atopic keratoconjunctivitis. Trachoma, Interstitial keratitis, Exposure keratopathy, Thygeson’s superficial punctate keratitis, Recurrent corneal erosions, Viral diseases like measles, Scarlet fever, Chronic blepharitis, Trichiasis, Peripheral vascularisation of the cornea.
#Overview - Salzmanns Nodular Degeneration - 9A78.4
Salzmann’s Nodular Degeneration is a non-inflammatory, degenerative process characterised by whitish-grey or bluish-white elevated sub-epithelial nodules in the superficial corneal stroma that are usually bilateral, mid-peripheral and slowly progressive. There is usually a clear area before the limbus. It can cause blurred vision if it occurs in central part blocking the visual axis. It occurs more often in women than in men. The nodules elevate the epithelium. Peripheral lesions tend to be vascularised and may look like pseudopterygium.
#Diagnosis - Salzmanns Nodular Degeneration - 9A78.4
Diagnosis of Salzmann’s nodular degeneration is usually made clinically. Diagnosis includes: Corneal topography, Anterior segment- Optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT), In vivo confocal microscopy. Histopathology: Haematoxylin & Eosin (H&E) stain, Light microscopy, Morphometric analysis.
#Treatment - Salzmanns Nodular Degeneration - 9A78.4
Management should be carried out under medical supervision. Many elderly patients who have peripheral Salzmann’s nodules are asymptomatic and do not require any treatment. Medical therapy: Medical therapy, successfully treats most patients, and may include: Topical artificial tears, Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, Topical corticosteroids. Surgical therapy: Indications for surgical therapy are: Persistent ocular surface discomfort due to foreign body sensation or tear film instability, Reduced visual acuity due to irregular astigmatism, Recurrent corneal erosions, Contact lens intolerance due to peripheral nodules. Surgical procedures are: Superficial keratectomy, Excimer laser phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK), Lamellar keratoplasty, Penetrating keratoplasty.
#Symptoms - Salzmanns Nodular Degeneration - 9A78.4
Many patients with Salzmann’s nodular degeneration are asymptomatic. Symptomatic patients may complain of: Ocular (eye) discomfort. Irritation, Foreign body sensation, Dryness, Pain if recurrent erosions occur, Photophobia, Decreased visual acuity.
