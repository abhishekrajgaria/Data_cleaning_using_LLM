#Complication - Myocardial Infarction - BA41.Z
Arrhythmia: An arrhythmia is an abnormal heartbeat, such as beating too quickly (tachycardia), too slowly (bradycardia) or irregularly (atrial fibrillation). Heart rupture: A heart rupture is a serious and relatively common complication of heart attacks.A heart rupture is where the heart’s muscles, walls, or valves rupture (split apart). Heart failure: Heart failure is a condition in which heart is unable to effectively pump blood around body. Cardiogenic shock: Cardiogenic shock is similar to heart failure but more serious.
#Diagnosis - Myocardial Infarction - BA41.Z
According to the WHO criteria as revised in 2000, a cardiac troponin rise accompanied by either typical symptoms, pathological Q waves, ST elevation or depression or coronary intervention are diagnostic of MI. Physical examination: The appearance of patients may vary according to the symptoms. A cold and pale skin is common and points to vasoconstriction. Some patients have low-grade fever (38–39 °C). Blood pressure may be elevated or decreased, and the pulse can become irregular. Electrocardiogram (ECG): 12-lead electrocardiogram showing ST-segment elevation in I and V1-V5 with reciprocal changes (blue) in the inferior leads, indicative of an anterior wall myocardial infarction. Cardiac markers: Cardiac markers or cardiac enzymes are proteins that leak out of injured myocardial cells through their damaged cell membranes into the bloodstream. Angiography: To restore blood flow, coronary angiography can be performed. Exercise stress test: This helps to determine how well heart is working when it has to pump more blood. Doppler test: A Doppler test uses reflected sound waves to see how blood flows through a blood vessel.
#Overview - Myocardial Infarction - BA41.Z
Myocardial Infarction(MI) also known as heart attack is one of the most common non-communicable diseases/ chronic diseases, which cannot be transmitted from person to person. It gradually progresses  and affects the blood supply to heart. A myocardial infarction is a serious medical emergency that occurs due to the blockage of one of the arteries which is supplying blood to the heart . Due to which ,lack of oxygen to heart causes characteristic chest pain and death of myocardial tissue.
#Riskfactor - Myocardial Infarction - BA41.Z
Risk factors associated with MI are: Age: With the increasing age chances of heart attack also increases. Gender: Men are more at risk than women. Diabetes mellitus(type 1 or 2). High blood pressure. Dyslipidemia / hypercholesterolemia (abnormal levels of lipoproteins in the blood), particularly high low-density lipoprotein, low high-density lipoprotein and high triglycerides. Tobacco smoking, including passive smoking. Family history of heart disease or myocardial infarction particularly if one has a first-degree relative (father, brother, mother, sister). Lack of physical activity. Alcohol — Studies show that prolonged exposure to high quantities of alcohol can increase the risk of heart attack. Oral contraceptive pill – Women who use combined oral contraceptive pills are at an increased risk of myocardial infarction, especially in the presence of other risk factors, such as smoking.
#Symptoms - Myocardial Infarction - BA41.Z
Generally, symptoms appear gradually. Chest pain is the most common symptom of acute myocardial infarction. It is often associated with: Sensation of tightness, Pressure, Squeezing. Levine's sign, in which the patient localizes the chest pain by clenching his fist over the sternum, has  been thought to be predictive of cardiac chest pain. Others symptoms include: Shortness of breath, Anxiety, Coughing, Wheezing.
#Treatment - Myocardial Infarction - BA41.Z
Oxygen and aspirin are usually administered as soon as possible. Anti platelets agents: Drugs like aspirin has been shown to markedly reduce mortality and thus should be taken as soon as possible in those without an allergy to it. Coronary angioplasty: In coronary angioplasty, a tiny tube known as a catheter, with a sausage-shaped balloon at the end, is put into a large artery of groin or arm. The catheter is passed through blood vessels and up to heart, over a fine guide wire, using X-rays to guide it, before being moved into the narrowed section of coronary artery. Once in position, the balloon is inflated inside the narrowed part of the artery to open it wide. Thrombolysis: Thrombolysis involves giving injections which contain thrombolytics. Thrombolytics target and destroy a substance called fibrin. Fibrin is a tough protein that makes up blood clots by acting like a sort of fibre mesh that hardens around the blood. Thrombolytic medications used in the treatment of heart attacks include reteplase, alteplase and streptokinase.
