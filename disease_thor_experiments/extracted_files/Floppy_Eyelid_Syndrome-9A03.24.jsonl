#Causes - Floppy Eyelid Syndrome - 9A03.24
Various causes have been implicated as aetiological factors. Decrease in the amount of elastin: Studies have shown significant decrease in the amount of elastin within the tarsal plate and eyelid skin. Poor contact of lax eyelid with the globe: Poor contact of lax eyelid with the globe in conjunction with abnormalities of meibomian glands and tear films, may contribute to the syndrome. Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA): Obstructive sleep apnoea may contribute to local eyelid ischaemia which may play a role in development of FES.
#Symptoms - Floppy Eyelid Syndrome - 9A03.24
Untreated FES may be associated with: Irritation of eyes. Matting or discharge from the eyes. Blepharoptosis and dermatochalasis may result from repetitive mechanical trauma due to lid-to-pillow contact. Punctate corneal keratopathy. Infectious keratitis. Bilateral corneal neovascularisation. Corneal ulceration. Corneal scarring.
#Overview - Floppy Eyelid Syndrome - 9A03.24
Floppy eyelid syndrome (FES) is frequently an unrecognised cause of chronic, non-infectious unilateral or bilateral papillary conjunctivitis. It is characterised by loose floppy eyelids associated with punctate epithelial keratopathy (PEK), ptosis of lateral eyelashes and typical conjunctival changes. It affects patients of both sexes ranging in age from two to eighty years, but it affects more commonly middle-aged obese males. The floppiness of the eyelids is due to laxity of the tarsus. Decrease in tarsal elastin contributes to the laxity of eyelids.
#Treatment - Floppy Eyelid Syndrome - 9A03.24
Medical therapy: It consists of: Mechanical shielding: Mechanical shielding of eyelids with tape may prevent eversion. Sleep mask: Sleep mask help in interrupting lid-pillow contact during sleep. Topical lubrication: Symptomatic topical lubrication helps in alleviating irritation and discharge from eyes. Avoid rubbing: Patients should avoid rubbing their eyes. Surgical therapy: Horizontal shortening of eyelids: Horizontal shortening of eyelids may be tried. Lateral canthopexy: Lateral canthopexy may be more effective form of shortening eyelid. Tarsorrhaphy: Patients who fail to respond to horizontal tightening may require tarsorrhaphy to prevent eyelid eversion.
#Diagnosis - Floppy Eyelid Syndrome - 9A03.24
Diagnosis depends upon: The identification of a lax, distensible tarsal plate. Papillary changes of the conjunctiva. Ready eversion of tarsal plates in classical cases on superior traction of the eyebrow. Differential diagnosis: It may be distinguished from conditions like: Allergic conjunctivitis. Ectropion.
