#Causes - Asbestos - CB20
There are six types of asbestos minerals (chrysotile, amosite, crocidolite, tremolite, anthophyllite and actinolite). All commercial forms of asbestos are carcinogenic. Asbestos can enter both in ground and surface water from natural and anthropogenic (changes in nature by people) sources. Soil can also contain asbestos through natural and anthropogenic (disposal of asbestos containing wastes in landfill) sources. Occupational exposure: The highest levels of exposure occur during repackaging of asbestos containers, mixing with other raw materials and dry cutting of asbestos-containing products with abrasive tools. Exposure of the general population: Inhalation and ingestion are the primary routes of exposure to asbestos. Inhalation of asbestos fibers from outdoor air and to a lesser degree in indoor air is the primary route of exposure for the non- smoking general population (white collar workers within the asbestos industry, individuals living in the vicinity of asbestos mines). 
#Complication - Asbestos - CB20
The spectrum of asbestos-related diseases includes the following: Benign pleural effusion- An abnormal collection of fluid between the thin layers of tissue (pleura) lining the lung and the wall of the chest cavity. Pleural plaques: calcified build up on the pleura. Diffuse pleural thickening: thickening of pleural lining. Rounded atelectasis: Abnormal form of lung collapse that occurs next to scarred pleural tissue. Asbestosis: It is severe scarring and inflammation of lung tissue. It prevents the lungs from expanding and relaxing normally. Mesothelioma: Cancer of pleura and peritoneum. Lung cancer: It is most common in people who were exposed to large quantities of asbestos for a prolonged period of time. Ovarian cancer: Researchers confirmed the link between asbestos exposure and ovarian cancer in the ovaries of asbestos-exposed women, Laryngeal cancer.           
#Overview - Asbestos - CB20
Asbestos is a group of naturally occurring fibrous minerals which are commercially used for insulation in buildings and as an ingredient in a number of products such as roofing tiles, water supply lines, and fire blankets, as well as clutches and brake linings, gaskets, and pads for automobiles. Asbestos causes cancer and chronic respiratory diseases in humans. All forms of asbestos (chrysotile, crocidolite, amosite, tremolite, actinolite and anthophyllite) are in use because of their extraordinary tensile strength, poor heat conduction, and relative resistance to chemical attack. Chemically, asbestos minerals are silicate compounds, meaning they contain atoms of silicon and oxygen in their molecular structure. All forms of asbestos are carcinogenic to humans. Exposure to asbestos (including chrysotile) causes cancer of the lung, larynx, and ovaries, and also mesothelioma (a cancer of the pleural and peritoneal linings). Asbestos exposure is also responsible for other diseases such as asbestosis (fibrosis of the lungs), and plaques, thickening and effusion in the pleura.
#Riskfactor - Asbestos - CB20
Factors affecting the risk of developing asbestos–related diseases: Dose( how much asbestos an individual was exposed to), Duration (how long an individual was exposed), Size, shape, and chemical composition of asbestos fibers, Source of the exposure, Individual risk factors such as smoking and pre-existing lung disease.
#Prevention - Asbestos - CB20
Workers can protect themselves in work place by taking various measures: Exposure by Inhalation can be prevented by use of breathing protection measures, fresh air and rest. Skin exposure can be prevented by use of protective gloves, protective clothing. Remove contaminated clothes. Rinse skin with plenty of water or take shower. Eyes should be protected by wearing safety goggles or eye protection in combination with breathing protection. If exposure to powder is there, first rinse with plenty of water for several minutes (remove contact lenses if easily possible), then refer for medical attention. Ingestion can be prevented by avoiding eating and drinking during work. Wash hands before eating. Rinse mouth. Don’t smoke. Take healthy diet with fresh seasonal fruits and vegetables. Preventive measures at work place: Substitution of asbestos with less harmful substances, dust control measures, rotation of work station for the employees, good ventilation facilities, periodic medical examination of employees, awareness about asbestos related diseases and health education among workers, Encourage healthy life style among workers.­
#Treatment - Asbestos - CB20
No specific therapy is recommended for asbestos related diseases. Smoking cessation, withdrawal from further exposure is advised. Treatment of asbestos –related disease includes vaccination against influenza and pneumococcal pneumonia, antimicrobial therapy for respiratory infections and the use of oxygen if necessary. Surveillance for lung cancer and mesothelioma should be done. A multidisciplinary approach focused on supportive care; multimodality treatment including surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy may be considered in cancer cases. 
#Symptoms - Asbestos - CB20
Repeated or prolonged inhalation of asbestos fibers may cause asbestosis (fibrosis of the lungs), pleural plaques, thickening and pleural effusion. Individuals who have been exposed (or suspect they have been exposed) to asbestos fibers on the job, through the environment, or at home via a family contact should consult their doctor whether or not they experience any symptoms. The symptoms of asbestos-related diseases may be apparent after many decades, such as; Shortness of breath, wheezing, or hoarseness, Persistence of cough gets worse over time, Blood in sputum, Pain or tightening in the chest, Difficulty swallowing, Swelling of the neck or face, Loss of appetite, Weight loss, Fatigue and anemia. The disease is progressive even after removal of the worker from the contact. In advanced cases there may be clubbing of finger nails, distress, and cyanosis.
#Diagnosis - Asbestos - CB20
A thorough physical examination is recommended with the following tests: Lung function test shows reduced vital capacity and expiratory volume, Sputum examination- Sputum shows asbestos bodies (which are asbestos fibers coated with fibrin), Chest X-ray- An X-ray of chest shows a ground –glass appearance in the lower two thirds of the lung fields, Ultrasonography of lungs is useful in characterizing pleural effusions and evaluating pleural thickening or masses, Computed tomography of lungs, Bronchoscopy, Lung biopsy.
