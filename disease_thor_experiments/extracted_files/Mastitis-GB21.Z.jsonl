#Complications - Mastitis - GB21.Z
Breast abscess- In about 3% of women with mastitis, breast abscess may occur.  A diagnostic breast ultrasound will identify a collection of fluid. The collection can often be drained by needle aspiration. Fluid or pus aspirated can be sent for culture. Systemic treatment with appropriate antibiotics is also required along with aspiration of pus. Mother should be encouraged for breastfeeding and reassured that milk is safe for her baby when she is taking appropriate antibiotic.
#Causes - Mastitis - GB21.Z
Milk stasis occurs when baby is not sucking properly, and milk is collected within the breast tissue of lactating woman, that may lead to non-infectious inflammation (or non-infectious mastitis). As the stagnant milk provides a suitable environment for the bacteria to grow (without effective removal of milk) non-infectious mastitis may progress to infectious mastitis, and further to formation of an abscess. Various reasons for milk stasis may be: Poor attachment of the infant at the breast; ineffective suckling; restriction of the frequency or duration of feeds; a blocked milk duct; an overabundant milk supply; lactating for twins or higher multiples. Cracked nipple: Fissured or painful nipples may lead to avoidance of feeding on the affected breast and thus predispose to milk stasis. The commonest cause of trauma is poor attachment at the breast. Bacteria from women’s skin or baby's mouth can enter the milk ducts through a crack in the skin of nipple or through a milk duct opening.
#Overview - Mastitis - GB21.Z
Mastitis is inflammation of the breast, which may or may not be accompanied by infection. Mastitis is more common in the lactational phase affecting one in five breastfeeding women. 74% to 95% cases of mastitis occur in the first 12 weeks after child birth especially in the second and third week postpartum. It is one of the reasons for early discontinuation of breastfeeding, which provides optimal infant nutrition.
#Diagnosis - Mastitis - GB21.Z
Examination of the infant and attachment to the breast: The infant should be examined for anatomical conditions such as cleft palate or tongue-tie which may interfere with attachment. Investigation- Mastitis is a clinical diagnosis and investigations are not indicated in the initial assessment. If symptoms don’t improve few days after proper management following investigations may be advised. Ultrasound: Breast infection that does not improve with a course of appropriate antibiotics should be investigated with breast ultrasound. Mammography: It is not a first line investigation in lactating women but is indicated if clinical, sonographic or biopsy features are suspicious for malignancy. Bacteriological examination: Breastmilk for culture may be obtained by collecting a hand-expressed midstream clean-catch sample into a sterile container (i.e., a small quantity of the initially expressed milk is discarded to avoid contamination of the sample with skin flora, and subsequent milk is expressed into the sterile container, taking care not to touch the inside of the container). Cleansing the nipple prior to collection may further reduce skin contamination and minimize false-positive culture results.
#Symptoms - Mastitis - GB21.Z
Breast pain is the primary symptom of mastitis. Other symptoms and signs of mastitis are: Breast swelling. Skin redness, often in a wedge-shaped pattern. Breast tenderness, or warmth to touch. Pain or a burning sensation continuously or while breast-feeding. Feeling ill. Fever of 101 F (38.3 C) or greater. Hard lump in breast. Discharge from nipple.
#Prevention - Mastitis - GB21.Z
Skilled help to promote/support breastfeeding- Women and those who care for them (mother and child) should know about effective breastfeeding management as it is beneficial for both- to feed the infant adequately and to keep the breasts healthy. Breastfeeding should be managed appropriately from the beginning to throughout the first two years of life to prevent situations which give rise to milk stasis. Important points are: Mother should start to breastfeed within an hour of delivery; make sure that the infant is well attached to the breast, taking care to prevent irritation and cracking of the nipple; breastfeed with no restrictions, in either the frequency or duration of feeds, and let the baby finish the first breast first, before offering the other; exclusive breastfeeding up to six months of age (the infant only receives breast milk without any additional food or drink, not even water); encourage breastfeeding ‘on demand’ (as often as the child wants, day and night); no use of bottles, teats or pacifier. Mothers should be taught to hand-express when the breasts are too full for the infant to attach or the infant does not relieve breast fullness. A breast pump may also be used, if available, for these purposes. During the time of weaning, mother should wean the baby over several weeks instead of suddenly stopping breast feeding.
#Treatment - Mastitis - GB21.Z
Management of mastitis consist of effective milk removal and antibiotics if infection is suspected. Simple analgesics like oral paracetamol and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs which are safe in breast feeding can be used to relieve pain. Support for continued breastfeeding: In addition to effective treatment and control of pain, a woman needs emotional support. Continued breastfeeding should be encouraged in the presence of mastitis and generally it does not pose a risk to the infant. She needs reassurance about the value of breastfeeding that it is safe to continue breastfeeding and milk from the affected breast will not harm her infant. Hot and cold packs to breast: As milk stasis is often the initiating factor in mastitis, mother can apply heat (warm compresses or a warm shower)) to the breast prior to feedings. Effective milk removal: This is the most essential part of management of mastitis. Antibiotics and symptomatic treatment may make a woman feel better temporarily, but unless milk removal is improved, the condition may become worse or relapse despite the antibiotics. Antibiotic therapy: Health care provider may advise for antibiotic therapy in following situations: cell and bacterial colony counts and culture of breast milk are available and indicate infection, symptoms are severe from the beginning, or a nipple fissure is visible, or symptoms do not improve after 12-24 hours of improved milk removal. The chosen antibiotic must be given for an adequate length of time. (Tetracycline, ciprofloxacin and chloramphenicol are not advised as they are unsafe for use in lactating women.).
