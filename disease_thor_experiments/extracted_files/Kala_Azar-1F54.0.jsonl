#Causes - Kala Azar - 1F54.0
There is only one sand fly vector of Kala-Azar in India i.e. Phlebotomus argentipes. Sand flies are small insects, about one fourth of the size of a mosquito. The length of a sand fly body ranges from 1.5 to 3.5 mm. Sand flies breed in high relative humidity, warm temperature, high subsoil water and abundance of vegetation. Sandflies breed in favourable micro-climatic conditions in places with high organic matter that serve as food for larvae. These are ecologically sensitive insects, fragile and cannot withstand desiccation.
#Diagnosis - Kala Azar - 1F54.0
Symptomatic: A case of fever of more than two weeks duration not responding to anti-malarials and antibiotics. Clinical laboratory findings may include anemia, progressive leucopenia thrombocytopenia and hypergammaglobulinemia. Laboratory: Serology tests: A variety of tests are available for diagnosis of Kala-azar. The most commonly used tests based on relative sensitivity; specificity and operational feasibility include Direct Agglutination Test (DAT), rk39 dipstick and ELISA. Parasite demonstration in bone marrow/spleen/lymph node aspiration or in culture medium is the confirmatory diagnosis.
#Overview - Kala Azar - 1F54.0
Kala-Azar is a slow progressing indigenous disease caused by a protozoan parasite of the genus Leishmania. In India Leishmania donovani is the only parasite that causes this disease. The parasite primarily infects the reticulo-endothelial system and may be found in abundance in bone marrow, spleen and liver.
#Prevention - Kala Azar - 1F54.0
There are no vaccines or preventive drugs for visceral leishmaniasis. The most effective method to prevent infection is to protect from sand fly bites. To decrease the risk of being bitten Following precautions are suggested: Outdoors: Avoid outdoor activities, especially from dusk to dawn, when sand flies generally are the most active. Apply insect repellent to exposed skin and under the ends of sleeves and pant legs. Indoors: Stay in well-screened or air-conditioned areas. Keep in mind that sand flies are much smaller than mosquitoes and therefore can get through smaller holes. Spray living/sleeping areas with an insecticide to kill insects. If possible, use a bed net that has been soaked in or sprayed with a pyrethroid-containing insecticide.
#Symptoms - Kala Azar - 1F54.0
Recurrent fever intermittent or remittent with often double rise of temperature. Loss of appetite, pallor and weight loss with progressive emaciation. Weakness. Skin - Dry, thin and scaly and hair may be lost. Light colored person show grayish discoloration of the skin of hands, feet, abdomen and face which gives the Indian name Kala-Azar meaning "Black fever". Anemia - develops rapidly. Splenomegaly - spleen enlarges rapidly to massive enlargement, usually soft and non-tender. Liver - enlargement not to the extent of spleen, soft, smooth surface, sharp edge.
#Treatment - Kala Azar - 1F54.0
Some of the drugs available for treatment of Kala-Azar in India: Sodium Stibogluconate. Pentamidine Isethianate. Amphotericin B. Liposomal Amphotericin B. Miltefosine.
