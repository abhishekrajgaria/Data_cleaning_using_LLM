#Diagnosis - Leprosy - 1B20.Z
Leprosy is diagnosed by finding at least one of the following cardinal signs (WHO): definite loss of sensation in a pale (hypopigmented) or reddish skin patch; thickened or enlarged peripheral nerve, with loss of sensation and/or weakness of the muscles supplied by that nerve; presence of acid-fast bacilli in a slit-skin smear. Leprosy is classified as paucibacillary (PB) or multibacillary (MB), based on the number of skin lesions, presence of nerve involvement and identification of bacilli on slit-skin smear.
#Causes - Leprosy - 1B20.Z
Mycobacterium leprae and Mycobacterium lepromatosis are the causative agents of leprosy. Mycobacterium can spread from person to person. This might happen when someone with the disease coughs or sneezes. This can release droplets into the air. It might also happen if somebody is exposed to other nasal fluids (also known as secretions) that might be contaminated with the bacteria.
#Prevention - Leprosy - 1B20.Z
Prevention of leprosy through chemoprophylaxis: Use of single dose rifampicin (SDR) is recommended as preventive treatment for contacts of leprosy patients (adults and children 2 years of age and above), after excluding leprosy and TB disease, and in the absence of other contraindications. Prevention of leprosy through immunoprophylaxis (vaccines): BCG vaccination at birth is effective at reducing risk of leprosy.
#Overview - Leprosy - 1B20.Z
Leprosy, also known as Hansen's disease (HD), is a chronic infectious disease caused by a Mycobacterium (Mycobacterium leprae) affecting especially the skin and marginal nerves. It is characterized by the formation of nodules or macules that enlarge and spread with loss of sensation and eventually paralysis, wasting of muscle, and production of deformities called also Hansen's disease. This infection is caused by the bacteria Mycobacterium leprae and Mycobacterium lepromatosis.
#Symptoms - Leprosy - 1B20.Z
The disease has following symptoms: Skin lesions that may be faded/discolored, Growths on the skin, Thick, stiff or dry skin, Severe pain, Numbness on affected areas of the skin, Muscle weakness or paralysis (especially in the hands and feet), Eye problems that may lead to blindness, Enlarged nerves (especially those around the elbow and knee), A stuffy nose, Ulcers on the soles of feet.
#Riskfactor - Leprosy - 1B20.Z
Those living in endemic areas with poor conditions such as: Inadequate bedding, Contaminated water, Insufficient diet, or other diseases that compromise immune function.
#Treatment - Leprosy - 1B20.Z
The multidrug therapy (MDT) is an effective and a powerful tool in curing leprosy. Adherence to treatment and its successful completion are equally important for the cure. The currently recommended MDT for PB leprosy is rifampicin and dapsone for 6 months and the currently recommended MDT for MB leprosy is rifampicin, clofazimine and dapsone for 12 months. MDT treatment is provided in blister packs, each containing four weeksâ€™ treatment. Specific blister packs are available for multibacillary (MB) and paucibacillary (PB) leprosy as well for adults and children. Multi drug therapy which consists of 3-drug regimen of rifampicin, dapsone and clofazimine for all leprosy patients, with a duration of treatment of 6 months for PB leprosy and 12 months for MB leprosy is recommended by WHO guidelines 2017*.
