#Overview - Hemangioma - 2E81.0Z
A haemangioma is a benign tumour of the endothelial cells that line blood vessels and is characterized by increased number of normal or abnormal vessels filled with blood. It is generally seen during the first week of life and resolves by the age of 10.  It is the most common tumour in infancy. Haemangiomas are connected to the circulatory system. The appearance depends upon its location. If they are on the surface of the skin, they are evocative of a ripe strawberry (hence, they are sometime called as "strawberry haemangiomas"). If they are just under the skin they present as a bluish swelling.
