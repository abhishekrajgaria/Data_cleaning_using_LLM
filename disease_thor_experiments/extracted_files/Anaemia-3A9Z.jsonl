#Causes - Anaemia - 3A9Z
Three main cause of anaemia are: Blood loss, Lack of red cell production, High rates of red blood cell destruction. 1) Blood loss: Blood loss is the most common cause of anaemia, especially in iron-deficiency anaemia. Blood loss can be short term or long term depending upon the conditions. Bleeding in the digestive or urinary tract can cause blood loss. Surgery, trauma, or cancer also can cause blood loss. Heavy blood loss due to menstruation. Lack of Red Blood cell production: It can be due to "acquired" or "Inherited". "Acquired" means that the person is not born with the condition, but may develop it at later stages. "Inherited" means that the condition has been passed by the parents. Acquired conditions and factors that can lead to anaemia include: Poor diet, Unusual hormonal levels, Chronic diseases. High rates of RBCs destruction: Factors that can cause destruction of red blood cells. One condition can be an enlarged or diseased spleen.This is an acquired condition.
#Overview - Anaemia - 3A9Z
The condition of having a lower-than-normal number of red blood cells or quantity of hemoglobin. Normal results vary. Anaemia has three main causes: blood loss, lack of red blood cell production, and high rates of red blood cell destruction. Conditions that may lead to anaemia include Heavy periods, Pregnancy, Ulcers, Colon polyps or colon cancer, Inherited disorders A diet that does not have enough iron, folic acid or vitamin B12, Blood disorders such as sickle cell anaemia and thalassemia, or cancer, Aplastic anaemia, a condition that can be inherited or acquired. Anaemia can make you feel tired, cold, dizzy, and irritable. You may be short of breath or have a headache.
#Diagnosis - Anaemia - 3A9Z
Medical History: Signs and symptoms like weakness, malaise or body aches. Blood tests: To check for the levels of hemoglobin (it is a protein that transports oxygen). Red blood cells (cells that contain hemoglobin)is lower than normal. Physical examination: Rapid or irregular heartbeat, Rapid or irregular breathing, Enlarged liver or spleen Complete blood count (CBC): A CBC is generally done to know the number of blood cells in the blood. To check anaemia, physician will see the levels of the red blood cells contained in the blood (hematocrit) and the hemoglobin in blood. A test to determine the size and shape of your red blood cells: Some of red blood cells may also be examined for unusual size, shape and color. This will help in diagnosis.
#Treatment - Anaemia - 3A9Z
Iron supplements:  The most commonly prescribed supplement is ferrous sulphate, taken orally (by mouth) two or three times a day. Dietary supplements: Iron-rich foods include: Dark-green leafy vegetables, such as spinach, Iron-fortified cereals Whole grains, such as brown rice, Beans, Nuts Meat, Apricots.
#Symptoms - Anaemia - 3A9Z
The most common symptom of anaemia is fatigue or weakness. Other signs and symptoms of anaemia include: Shortness of breath, Dizziness, Headache Coldness in the hands and feet, Pale skin, Chest pain.
#Complications - Anaemia - 3A9Z
Iron deficiency anaemia rarely causes  any serious or long-term complications. However, some of the complications are listed below: Tiredness. Iron deficiency anaemia can leave a person tired and lethargic (lacking in energy), as a result person may be less productive and active at work. Immune system. Iron deficiency anaemia can affect immune system (the bodyâ€™s natural defence system), making a person more susceptible to illness and infection. Heart and lung complications. Adults with severe anaemia may be at risk of developing complications that affect their heart or lungs. For example, Tachycardia (an abnormally fast heartbeat), Heart failure, when your heart is not pumping blood around your body very efficiently Pregnancy. Pregnant women with severe anaemia have an increased risk of developing complications, particularly during and after the birth. They may also develop postnatal depression (a type of depression some women experience after having a baby).
