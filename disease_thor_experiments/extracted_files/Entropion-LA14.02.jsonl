#Causes - Entropion - LA14.02
Involutional or senile entropion is the most common type and affects lower lid only. Following age related changes contribute to involutional entropion. Overriding of pre-septal over the pre-tarsal part of orbicularis oculi muscle, during closure of eyelids. This moves the lower border of the tarsus away from the globe and the upper border toward the globe. Horizontal lid laxity produced by thinning and atrophy of the tarsus and the canthal tendons. Due to this laxity, middle part of lower lid when pulled away from the globe does not snap back to its normal position. Weakness of the lower lid retractors which can be assessed clinically by decreased excursion of the lower lid in down-gaze. Cicatricial entropion is usually due to scarring of palpebral conjunctiva, which pull lid margin towards the eyeball. It is usually secondary to systemic and progressive inflammatory conditions. Conditions which may lead to cicatricial entropion are: Trachoma, Chemical burns of conjunctiva, Ocular cicatricial pemphigoid, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, Trauma.
#Diagnosis - Entropion - LA14.02
Diagnosis depends upon elucidation of causative factors and clinical examination. Snap back test: Examiner pulls lower lid down and observes the lid returning to its original position without allowing patient to blink. Normally, lid returns back quickly without blinking, but in increased laxity, blink may be needed for its return to normal position. Lower lid retractor function: This is evaluated by measuring lower lid excursion in downward gaze. Lower lid retractors cause 3-4mm inferior movement of lower lid margin in downgaze.
#Overview - Entropion - LA14.02
Entropion is an abnormality resulting in inversion (inward turning) of the eyelid margin. Entropion causes irritation to the exposed surface of the eyeball. Entropion can damage conjunctival and corneal surface which may lead to corneal abrasion, scarring, corneal thinning or neovascularisation. Advanced cases may develop corneal ulceration or even perforation.
#Symptoms - Entropion - LA14.02
Symptoms are due to irritation of anterior ocular (pertaining to eye) surface, being produced by inward turning of eyelid margin. Patient may present with: Foreign body sensation in eye, Irritation of eyes due to pseudotrichiasis, Redness of eyes, Tearing/ watering of eyes, Eye discharge, Pain in eyes, Photophobia (intolerance) to light, Corneal abrasion, Corneal ulceration, Symblepharon (adhesion of eyelids to the eyeball), Loss of normal eyelid margin structures, Dryness of eyes due to keratinisation.
#Treatment - Entropion - LA14.02
Management should be carried out under medical supervision. Medical non-invasive management may involve: Taping of lower eye lid to malar (cheekbone) eminence, Application of cyanoacrylate liquid bandage to evert the eye lid, Botulinum toxin injection to the orbicularis oculi muscle may weaken it and help in prevention of override, Use of lubricating artificial tear preparations to protect ocular surface. Surgical management: Various surgical procedures may be done e.g. application of cautery, lid rotational sutures, shortening of lower lid retractors, Wies and Fox procedure. Mild cases may be treated by tarsal fracture and severe cases may be treated with mucous membrane grafts. Eyelid everting sutures may be applied. Tarsal fixation suture may prevent corneal damage.
