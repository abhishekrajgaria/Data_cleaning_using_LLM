#Overview - Yellow Fever - 1D47
Yellow fever is a serious viral infection that is   spread by a   mosquito known as the Aedes aegypti mosquito. The causative agent is virus   of the Flavivirus genus. Yellow fever mainly occurs in sub-Saharan Africa (countries to the south of the Sahara desert), South America and in parts of the Caribbean. There are two forms of yellow fever: Urban and Jungle. Clinically and etiologically they are identical.
#Symptoms - Yellow Fever - 1D47
Incubation period of yellow fever is   3-6 days. Symptoms occur in 2 stages: The first stage is also known as the 'acute phase', include: A high temperature (fever) of 38ºC (100.4ºF) or above. Chills (shivers). Headache. Nausea and vomiting. Muscle pain, including backache. Loss of appetite. Second stage is more severe and is referred to as the 'toxic phase'. The symptoms can include: A recurrent fever. Abdominal pain. Vomiting. Jaundice – a yellow tinge to the skin and whites of the eyes caused by liver damage. Kidney failure. Bleeding from the mouth, nose, eyes or stomach, leading to blood in your vomit and stools (faeces).
#Causes - Yellow Fever - 1D47
Yellow fever is caused by a type of virus known as a flavivirus. The infection is transmitted by the bite of certain mosquitoes. If one is travelling, developing risks of yellow fever will depend on: Where you are travelling to and whether there is currently an outbreak of yellow fever in the area. Whether you have been vaccinated for yellow fever. Whether you are visiting jungle or forested areas.
#Prevention - Yellow Fever - 1D47
Yellow fever can be prevented by taking vaccination against it. A single injection of yellow fever vaccine given subcutaneously provides immunity to 100% of its recipients. The vaccine provides immunity only after 10 days of vaccination. It confers lifelong immunity to people residing in  yellow fever endemic countries. However, booster dose is required every ten years by persons residing in non endemic countries. The vaccine is contraindicated in persons allergic to egg, hypersensitive to previous dose, pregnant females, children younger than 9 months of age or with compromised immune diseases. The vaccine can be accompanied with mild side effects like fever, soreness, redness or swelling where the shot was given. These side effects usually subside within a week.
#Treatment - Yellow Fever - 1D47
There is no specific treatment for yellow fever. However, symptoms can be relieved by symptomatic treatment. Fever, headache and back pain can be treated with the help of pain-killers like paracetamol. In addition, patient should be advised to drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration. Associated bacterial infections can be treated with antibiotics.
#Diagnosis - Yellow Fever - 1D47
Yellow fever is usually diagnosed based on the symptoms and the results of a blood test. In blood tests: The blood test may also show a reduction in the number of infection-fighting white blood cells (leucopenia). This can occur because the yellow fever virus affects bone marrow (the spongy material at the centre of some bones that produces blood cells). Laboratory diagnosis of yellow fever is generally accomplished by testing of serum to detect virus-specific IgM and neutralizing antibodies.
