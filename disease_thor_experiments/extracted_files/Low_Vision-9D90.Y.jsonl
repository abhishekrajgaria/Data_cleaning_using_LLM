#Causes - Low Vision - 9D90.Y
Causes of Low Vision: Age-related Macular Degeneration, Refractive Errors like High Myopia, Strabismic Amblyopia, Cataract, Diabetic Retinopathy, Glaucoma, Retinal Detachment, Retinitis Pigmentosa, Retinopathy of Prematurity, Optic Nerve Diseases like Optic Atrophy, Heredomacular degeneration (Stargardt’s disease), Albinism, Nystagmus, Brain damage.
#Diagnosis - Low Vision - 9D90.Y
Most people requiring visual aids have macular problems. Tests are done to assess the degree of vision and the visual field. It includes: Refraction: As full a refraction as possible, should be attempted, and a subjective test should be performed with special test types. It is done to check the visual status of an individual. A trial frame and lenses should always be used, not a large refracting unit, which may interfere with eccentric viewing. Visual fields: It is done to assess the peripheral vision.
#Symptoms - Low Vision - 9D90.Y
Symptoms of Low vision: In spite of best medical, surgical and/or optical correction, there is: Difficulty recognising objects at distance, Difficulty in reading or close work, Difficulty in colour differentiation.
#Overview - Low Vision - 9D90.Y
Low vision was defined as ‘Visual acuity of 6/18 down to and including 3/60 in the better eye’. A person with low vision is ‘someone who, after medical, surgical and/or optical intervention, has a corrected visual acuity in the better eye of   <6/18 down to and including light perception or a central visual field of   <20 degrees, but who uses or has the potential to use vision for the planning and/or execution of a task.’ Thus, Low vision is a reduced level of vision that cannot be fully corrected with conventional glasses. In 10th revision of the International classification of the diseases, the term low vision is replaced by terms ‘moderate visual impairment’ and ‘severe visual impairment’, from all causes.
#Treatment - Low Vision - 9D90.Y
Low vision aids may be: OPTICAL  DEVICES: Hand-held Magnifiers:  Hand-held magnifiers are the simplest type of magnifiers. Stand Magnifiers: Stand Magnifier is a plus lens mounted on legs that fix the distance from the lens to object. Magnifying Reading Glasses: Magnifying reading glasses have plus lenses for short term use as a replacement, but cannot substitute the prescription glasses.  Spectacle Magnifiers:  Spectacle magnifiers are ideal for extended near tasks like reading or working on hobbies because they allow users to have hands free. Telescopes: Telescopes as vision aids, are ideal for tasks at any distance and for any duration of time. Technical  Magnifier: Technical magnifiers are ideal for extended near tasks such as inspection, quality control or viewing objects. Technical magnifiers may be hand-held magnifiers or stand magnifiers. Lamp Magnifiers: Lamp magnifiers sit on or clamp on to a table or desk and have illumination. NON-OPTICAL DEVICES: Flexible-Arm Task Lamps, Full Spectrum Light Bulbs, Absorptive Sun lenses/Sun glasses, Coloured Acetate Sheets. NON-MAGNIFYING VISUAL AIDS: Stenopaeic Hole: Stenopaeic hole is useful in any error of refraction or where the transparency of the ocular media is at fault. ELECTRONIC DEVICES: Video Magnifiers, E-readers, Smartphones and Tablets.
