#Treatment - Coronavirus disease - RA01.0
People who think they may have been exposed to COVID-19 should take precautionary measures to prevent further transmission of infection and should be quarantined, and if symptoms appear they should contact their healthcare provider immediately. Patients with suspected or confirmed mild COVID-19 are advised for isolation to break the chain of transmission. They can be managed with symptomatic treatment such as antipyretics for fever and pain, adequate nutrition and appropriate rehydration. Patients with suspected or confirmed moderate COVID-19 (pneumonia) are managed at Dedicated Covid Health Centre with close monitoring for signs or symptoms of disease progression. Severe cases are managed at dedicated Covid hospitals. Isolation- Those people who are suffering from COVID-19 should stay away from others even in their homes. This is called isolation. Quarantine-Those people who might have been exposed to COVID-19 should stay away from others. This is called quarantine.
#Diagnosis - Conjunctivochalasis - 9A11.3
CCh is one of the most common under diagnosed and misdiagnosed ocular surface disease. Non-specific symptoms along with intermittent findings of conjunctival oedema often lead to misdiagnosis. Due to fluctuation in findings of disease process, several clinical exams may be required to confirm the diagnosis. Diagnosis of CCh is mainly clinical. Slit lamp biomicroscopy (by an eye specialist) shows prolapsed or folds of conjunctiva in temporal, nasal or central part of lower lid-margin. Presence of redundant conjunctiva over lower lid margin suggests CCh. Prolapsed conjunctiva causes a disruption of tear movement and outflow through inferior lacrimal punctum resulting in epiphora.
#Causes - Conjunctivochalasis - 9A11.3
No true aetiology is known for conjunctivochalasis. Senile changes involving the subcutaneous, elastic or supporting tissue in the conjunctiva was suggested as the cause. Eye rubbing, mechanical irritation or trauma to conjunctiva, and abnormal eyelid position were all implicated.
#Overview - Conjunctivochalasis - 9A11.3
Conjunctivochalasis (CCh) is defined as the presence of redundant non-oedematous conjunctiva that may be asymptomatic, or it may be symptomatic due to unstable tear film or mechanical disruption of tear flow. Conjunctivochalasis is usually found in older people and is often overlooked, and is classified as a normal variant of eye due to ageing. However, it has been seen in patients as early as first decade of life with an increase in prevalence and severity with age. It is usually bilateral condition and consists of an elevation of the bulbar conjunctiva over the lower lid margin, most commonly in the infero-temporal region. However, in addition to temporal region, it may involve bulbar conjunctiva along nasal, central lid-margin or any combination of these areas. The presence of loose redundant tissue causes disruption of inferior tear meniscus. This conjunctival prolapse may impede tear outflow through the inferior punctum, resulting in epiphora (watering from eyes).  It may also involve upper bulbar area with loose conjunctiva, but it is less common.
#Symptoms - Conjunctivochalasis - 9A11.3
Conjunctivochalasis may be asymptomatic. Symptoms are non-specific and the onset is insidious. Ocular (eye) symptoms of conjunctivochalasis may be: Irritation. Foreign body sensation. Discomfort. Burning. Lacrimation or watering. Discharge. Blurred vision. Dryness. Subconjunctival haemorrhage. Ocular fatigue. Eye stiffness on awakening. Symptoms of CCh tend to worsen with both down gaze and digital pressure.
#Treatment - Conjunctivochalasis - 9A11.3
Management should be carried out under medical supervision. Asymptomatic conjunctivochalasis requires no treatment. Treat associated ocular diseases such as: Dry eye, Anterior blepharitis, Meibomian gland disease, Allergic eye conditions. Medical therapy: Topical artificial tears lubrication: Topical artificial tears help in lubrication and may provide temporary relief. Topical steroids: Similar to artificial tears, topical corticosteroids also provide some relief and may be used for mild presentations. Antihistamines: Antihistamines are useful if there is a component of allergic conjunctivitis.
