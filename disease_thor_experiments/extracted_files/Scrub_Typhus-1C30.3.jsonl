#Causes - Scrub Typhus - 1C30.3
Scrub typhus is caused by a bacterium called Orientia tsutsugamushi. Infection is transmitted by the mite Leptotrombidium deliense. Human beings are infected when they walk into the mite islands (areas in the soil where the microecosystem is favourable for mites) and are bitten by the mite larvae (chiggers). The microbes are transmitted through ovarian transmission (certain arthropod vectors transmit disease-causing bacteria from parent arthropod to offspring arthropod) in mites.
#Overview - Scrub Typhus - 1C30.3
Scrub typhus is an acute, febrile, infectious illness that is caused by Orientia (formerly Rickettsia) tsutsugamushi. It is also known as tsutsugamushi disease or Chigger borne typhus. It is a zoonotic disease, transmitted by arthropod vector trombiculid mite. Humans are accidental hosts in this disease.
#Symptoms - Scrub Typhus - 1C30.3
A Papule develops at the site of bite. Bites are often found on the groin, axillae, genitalia or neck.  The papule ulcerates and eventually heals with development of a black eschar. Onset is acute with chills and fever (1040-1050 F), severe headache, infection of the mucous membrane lining the eyes (the conjunctiva), and swelling of the lymph nodes. Approximately one week later, a spotted and then maculopapular rash appears first on the trunk and then on the extremities and blenches within a few days.
#Complication - Scrub Typhus - 1C30.3
Complications are interstitial pneumonia (30 to 65% of cases), meningoencephalitis and myocarditis. In severe cases with pneumonia and myocarditis, the mortality rate may reach 30%.
#Diagnosis - Scrub Typhus - 1C30.3
Scrub typhus commonly presents as an undifferentiated fever that requires laboratory confirmation for the diagnosis, Blood test: may reveal early lymphopenia with late lymphocytosis and Thrombocytopenia. Urine test: Albuminuria. Scrub typhus may be diagnosed in the laboratory by: Isolation of the organism. Serology. Molecular diagnosis (PCR). Several serological tests available for the diagnosis are Weil-Felix Test (WFT), Indirect Immunoflourescent test (IIF), Enzyme linked Immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
#Prevention - Scrub Typhus - 1C30.3
There is no vaccine for scrub typhus. In endemic areas, certain precautions should be taken: Wear protective clothing. Insect repellents containing dibutyl phthalate, benzyl benzoate, diethyl toluamide, and other substances can be applied to the skin and clothing to prevent chigger bites. Do not sit or lie on bare ground or grass; use a suitable ground sheet or other ground cover. Clearing of vegetation and chemical treatment of the soil, rodent control may help to break up the cycle of transmission.
#Treatment - Scrub Typhus - 1C30.3
Scrub typhus is treated with antibiotics. Treatment to be given will depend on the age of patient, pregnancy status of female patient. For further details consult the physician.
