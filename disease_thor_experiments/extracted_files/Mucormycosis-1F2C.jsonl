#Causes - Mucormycosis - 1F2C
Mucormycosis is a fungal infection caused by a group of fungi called mucormycetes. These fungi are naturally found in the soil and decaying organic matter like decaying vegetation. It enters in the body through inhalation of fungal spores present in the air. Fungus can also infect skin after a cut, burn, or skin injury. These fungi normally don’t cause infection as our immune system successfully fights such fungal infections. However in people with weak immune system they can cause serious life threatening infections.
#Diagnosis - Mucormycosis - 1F2C
Medical history, symptoms, physical examination and laboratory tests are required for the diagnosis of mucormycosis. If there is suspicion of mucormycosis, imaging tests such as a CT scan of lungs, sinuses, or other parts of the body may be done depending on the location of the suspected infection. The healthcare provider might collect a sample of fluid from the respiratory system for laboratory diagnosis. A tissue biopsy may be done, in which a small sample of affected tissue is analyzed under the microscope.
#Overview - Mucormycosis - 1F2C
Mucormycosis (black fungus) is a fungal infection caused by a group of fungi called mucormycetes. These fungi are naturally found in air, water and even food. It enters in the body after inhaling fungal spores from the air and commonly affects sinuses and lungs. It can also infect skin after a cut, burn, or skin injury. It is a rare infection. Mucormycosis mainly affects people who are on medication for other health problems that reduces their ability to fight environmental pathogens. During COVID-19 pandemic, the occurrence of mucormycosis has been reported among patients who are either recovering or recovered from COVID -19 in the presence of diabetes and steroid use.
#Riskfactor - Mucormycosis - 1F2C
Certain groups of people are at greater risk of developing mucormycosis, such as people with certain health problems such as uncontrolled diabetes, cancer, organ and stem cell transplant, neutropenia, receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics or immunosuppressive drugs. According to an advisory issued by the Indian Council of Medical Research, the following conditions in COVID-19 patients increase the risk of mucormycosis infection: Uncontrolled diabetes, Weakening of immune system due to use of steroids, Prolonged ICU/hospital stay, Co-morbidities / post organ transplant / cancer, Voriconazole therapy (used to treat serious fungal infections).
#Symptoms - Mucormycosis - 1F2C
Symptoms of mucormycosis vary, depending on which organ/part of the human body it infects. Rhino-orbital-cerebral mucormycosis: when infection occurs from inhalation of spores, it infects the nose, orbit of eye / eye socket, oral cavity and can even spread to the brain. Symptoms develop as headache, nasal congestion, nasal discharge (green colour), pain in sinus, bleeding nose, swelling on face, lack of sensation on face and skin discoloration. Pulmonary mucormycosis: When spores are breathed in and reach the respiratory system, they affect the lungs. Symptoms are fever, chest pain, cough and coughing of blood. Cutaneous mucormycosis can look like blisters or ulcers on the skin, and the infected area may turn black. Other symptoms include pain, warmth, excessive redness, or swelling around a wound. The fungus can also infect gastrointestinal tract with the symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting.
#Treatment - Mucormycosis - 1F2C
Mucormycosis is a serious infection and needs to be treated with intravenous (through a vein) anti-fungal medicine. Control of diabetes and diabetic ketoacidosis is an essential part of the management. Steroids (if patient is still on) should be reduced with the aim to discontinue rapidly. Immunomodulating drugs should be discontinued. Medical treatment (as advised by ICMR): Install peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC line), Maintain adequate systemic hydration, Infuse Normal Saline IV before Amphotericin B infusion, Antifungal Therapy, for at least 4-6 weeks, Monitor patients clinically and with radio-imaging for response and to detect disease progression.
#Prevention - Mucormycosis - 1F2C
General preventive measures: People who work at or visit construction sites should use masks. Shoes, long trousers, long sleeve shirts and gloves should be worn while handling soil (gardening), moss or manure. Maintain personal hygiene including thorough scrub bath. In the time of COVID-19-as advised by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR): Control hyperglycemia (high blood sugar levels). Patients should maintain proper hygiene by keeping their hands as well as body clean. Masks should be disinfected daily. Use antibiotics/antifungals judiciously. Preventive measures to be taken by COVID-19 patients: Diabetic patients should always monitor and control their blood sugar level. Don’t miss to observe even minor symptoms: Pain and redness around eyes and nose, fever (usually mild), epistaxis (bleeding from the nose), nasal or sinus congestion, headache, cough, shortness of breath, vomiting of blood, altered mental status and partial loss of vision. Good dental health by brushing of teeth, flossing, mouth-washing and rinsing should be maintained.
