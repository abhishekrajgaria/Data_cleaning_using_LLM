#Diagnosis - Lid Imbrication Syndrome - LA14.02
Diagnosis of lid imbrication syndrome is primarily clinical. On physical examination of the eyes, the condition is best evaluated by having the patient tilt head back and then observing from beneath with a penlight whether the upper eyelid overrides the lower or not. Many patients have gelatinous thickening of the upper eyelid tarsal marginal conjunctiva. Vital staining: Topical rose bengal or lissamine green staining may be used to diagnose lid imbrications. These stain the tarsal conjunctiva along the upper eyelid margin. The severity of staining correlates to the severity of symptoms. In addition to upper eyelid laxity, some patients have concomitant lower eyelid laxity without ectropion.
#Causes - Lid Imbrication Syndrome - LA14.02
Lid imbrication syndrome is an idiopathic eyelid mal-position disorder and is characterized by upper eyelid overriding the lower eyelid. Lid imbrication syndrome may be seen as Acquired condition: When acquired, it is commonly associated with floppy eyelid syndrome. Congenital condition: Congenital occurrence is very rare. Post-surgical condition: Occasionally, it may follow lower eyelid tarsal strip surgery. Closure of the eyelids is primarily is a function of the upper eyelid, with the lower lid exhibiting very little upward movement during closure of the eyes.
#Overview - Lid Imbrication Syndrome - LA14.02
Lid imbrication syndrome refers to abnormality of lid apposition in which upper eyelid overrides the lower eyelid. This causes lower eyelid lashes and keratinised epithelium to rub chronically against the upper eyelid marginal tarsal conjunctiva. This leads to keratinisation of the upper eyelid margin and metaplasia of the distal tarsal conjunctiva. The resulting abnormal distal superior palpebral surface, in turn, irritates the underlying corneal surface on blinking and prohibits normal replenishment of the tear film. There are symptoms of dryness due to poor tear film being produced by disruption in tear film mechanics. It may lead to persistent corneal epithelial defects.
#Symptoms - Lid Imbrication Syndrome - LA14.02
Lid imbrication syndrome may present with symptoms such as: Irritation of eyes, Foreign body sensation, Burning of eyes, Symptoms of dryness of eyes, Persistent corneal epithelial defects, Overriding upper eyelid on the lower eyelid.
#Treatment - Lid Imbrication Syndrome - LA14.02
Management should be carried out under medical supervision. Medical management to stabilise the ocular surface and reduce inflammation is required, but often it is important to surgically address the abnormal eyelid position. Medical therapy: Artificial tears: Initial management consists of lubrication with artificial tears. Surgical therapy: Horizontal tightening of upper eyelid: Horizontal tightening of upper eyelid to prevent upper tarsal and lower eyelid apposition may be tried. Temporary tarsorrhaphy: Patients with persistent corneal epithelial defects due to lid imbrication syndrome may require temporary tarsorrhaphy to prevent the upper eyelid from overriding the lower eyelid. Lower eyelid may be tightened, if it is also lax.
