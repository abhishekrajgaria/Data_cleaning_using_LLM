#Causes - Silicosis - CA60.0Z
Silicosis is caused by exposure to crystalline silica. Silica (SiO2 / silicon dioxide) is combination of silicon and oxygen. Silicon is very reactive, does not remain in the element form but combines either with oxygen and forms free silica (SiO2) or with oxygen and other elements and forms silicates such as asbestos. Silica and silicates constitute the bulk of most kinds of rocks, clays and sands. Crystalline silica is found in rock, brick, and concrete. Grinding, sawing, crushing, or drilling of these materials produce a fine powder that causes serious respiratory problems.Occupational exposure to silica occurs at workplaces in factories like quartz crushing facilities (silica flour milling), agate, ceramic, slate pencil, glass, stone quarries and mines. Silica flour in India is produced by small factories. Non-occupational exposure to silica- Silicosis is also reported in population with Non-occupational exposure from industrial sources and non-industrial sources.
#Overview - Silicosis - CA60.0Z
Silicosis is one of the most important occupational health illnesses in the world. It is a progressive lung disease caused by inhalation of silica over a long period of time. Silicosis is characterized by shortness of breath, cough, fever and bluish skin. Silica (SiO2 / silicon dioxide) is crystal-like mineral found in abundance in sand, rock, and quartz. Silicosis occurs most commonly as an occupational disease in people working in the quarrying, manufacturing and building construction industries. It is also reported from population with non-occupational exposure to silica dust from industrial as well as nonindustrial sources.
#Symptoms - Silicosis - CA60.0Z
Silicosis is characterized by shortness of breath, cough, fever and bluish skin. Early symptoms of silicosis start with shortness of breath after exercising and a harsh, dry cough. Patients may have more trouble breathing; phlegm production and cough up blood as the disease progresses. Congestive heart failure can give their nails a bluish tint. Patients with advanced silicosis may have trouble sleeping and experience chest pain, hoarseness, and loss of appetite. Silicosis patients are at high risk for Tuberculosis (TB). Silicosis can present in three different forms as acute, accelerated and chronic. 
#Diagnosis - Silicosis - CA60.0Z
Investigations include: Chest X-ray: Chest radiography is the most important tool for the diagnosis of silicosis. Lung function test: spirometry. Sputum examination: It may be needed to assess for associated diseases, such as tuberculosis (TB). Though the detection of tubercle bacilli in the sputum of patients suffering from silicotuberculosis is difficult, because of walling in of the tubercle foci by silicotic fibrosis which prevents the discharge of tubercle bacilli in the sputum. High resolution CT scan of the chest. Pulse oximetry. Bronchoscopy to evaluate the inside of the lungs. Biopsy of the lungs.
#Prevention - Silicosis - CA60.0Z
Prevention of silicosis is an important step in the field of occupational health. The best way to prevent silicosis is to identify workplace activities that produce crystalline silica dust and then to eliminate or control the dust. An effective silicosis preventive strategy is based on the primary and secondary prevention approaches. Primary prevention includes the control of silica hazard at source by the engineering methods of dust control. If occupational exposure to dust is avoided, silicosis will cease to occur. Secondary prevention includes the surveillance of the working environment to assess the adequacy of dust control measures, exposure evaluation to assess the health risk for workers, and surveillance of the workersâ€™ health for early detection of the disease.
#Treatment - Silicosis - CA60.0Z
As there is no cure for silicosis, prevention is still the best way to avoid the disease. Once diagnosis of silicosis is confirmed, management depends on the degree of lung damage. Mild to moderate cases may need medicines to decrease sputum production, such as inhaled steroids and inhaled bronchodilators to relax the air tubes. While in severe cases people may need urgent treatment with oxygen and support for breathing. Oxygen support or other ways to manage chronic lung failure, like the use of noninvasive ventilator devices, may be needed. In severe cases lung transplant may be considered.
