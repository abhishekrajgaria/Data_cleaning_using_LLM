#Complication - Avian Influenza - 1E31
Complications of A(H5N1) and A(H7N9) infection include: hypoxemia,,multiple organ dysfunction, secondary bacterial and fungal infections.
#Causes - Avian Influenza - 1E31
Disease is caused by avian influenza virus belongs to the Influenza A genus of the orthomyxoviridae family. High pathogenic viruses are responsible for high death rates (up to 100% mortality within 48 hours) in some poultry species. Low pathogenic viruses, which are not, associated with severe disease but cause outbreak in poultry species. Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses are mainly restricted to H5, and H7 subtypes which are in circulation in poultry. Transmission- Infected birds shed avian influenza virus in their saliva, mucous and faeces. Following direct close or prolonged contact with sick or dead infected poultry, viruses enter into a person's eyes, nose or mouth, or are inhaled.
#Diagnosis - Avian Influenza - 1E31
Diagnosis of Avian influenza is suspected in all persons presenting with acute febrile respiratory illness in those countries or territories where avian influenza A viruses have been identified in animal populations. Presenting signs and symptoms of AI illness are non-specific therefore a detailed exposure history should be taken including any close/direct contact with sick or dead poultry, wild birds, other severely ill persons, travel to an area with AI activity, or work in laboratory handling samples possibly containing AI virus. Avian influenza A virus infection is usually diagnosed by collecting a swab from the nose or throat of the sick person during the first few days of illness. Following tests may be used to detect avian influenza in human samples- Viral RNA detection by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and real time RT- PCR assay, Virus culture, Rapid antigen detection, Serological identification of antibodies against avian influenza A viruses.
#Overview - Avian Influenza - 1E31
Avian influenza (AI) is an infectious viral disease of birds, commonly known as bird flu. Wild water fowl such as ducks and geese are mostly affected by AI, but often show no apparent signs of illness. Poultry birds are also susceptible to AI infection that can cause large outbreaks and epidemics in poultry. Humans are not usually affected by AI virus, however some subtypes of AI such as A(H5N1) and A(H7N9), have caused serious infections in people. Other avian influenza subtypes, including H7N3, H7N7, and H9N2, have also infected people.
#Riskfactor - Avian Influenza - 1E31
Direct or indirect exposure to infected live or dead poultry or contaminated environments, such as live bird markets are the primary risk factors for getting the infection. Consumption of dishes made of raw, contaminated poultry blood can cause infection. Slaughter, defeathering, handling carcasses of infected poultry, and preparing poultry for consumption, especially in household settings, are likely to be risk factors. Properly prepared poultry or eggs usually do not transmit the disease. Current epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that AI virus is not transmitted human to human.
#Prevention - Avian Influenza - 1E31
Persons who work with poultry or who respond to avian influenza outbreaks are advised to use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) and follow proper hand hygiene. WHO has advised that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should avoid poultry farms, contact with animals in live bird markets, entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water. Travellers should follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices. Control measures in birds- When outbreak of AI occurs in birds, the immediate priority should be to contain the disease and eliminate the disease by destroying the infected or exposed birds (culling or stamping out), proper disposal of carcasses (burial), decontamination of the affected premises, movement controls, restocking of the bird after a safe period of destocking.
#Symptoms - Avian Influenza - 1E31
In Infection caused by low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) A virus, sign and symptoms ranged from conjunctivitis to influenza-like illness like fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches to lower respiratory disease (pneumonia) requiring hospitalization. Some patients may show symptoms of lower respiratory tract involvement early in the illness. Respiratory distress, a hoarse voice, and a crackling sound during inhalation are common findings. Some patients may suffer from diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, chest pain, and bleeding from the nose and gums and sometime neurological changes (altered mental status, seizures).
#Treatment - Avian Influenza - 1E31
Hospital care is recommended in initial stages of the disease (such as Human infection with an A(H5N1) to monitor clinical status. Along with supportive therapy some antiviral drugs, especially oseltamivir, can be used. It reduces the duration of viral replication and improves prospects of survival. Antiviral treatment (oseltamivir) is given as early as possible based on clinical suspicion (ideally, within 48 hours following symptom onset) and before confirmation of causative agent. In suspected case a standard five day course should be given, unless any other diagnosis is confirmed. In a confirmed case depending on the clinical status, dose and duration of the oseltamivir therapy can be increased by treating clinician. The use of corticosteroids is not recommended by WHO.
