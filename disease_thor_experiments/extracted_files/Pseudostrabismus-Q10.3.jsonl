#Diagnosis - Pseudostrabismus - Q10.3
Diagnosis depends upon clinical history, physical examination and certain diagnostic tests. A good physical examination comprises of inspection of eye and adnexal morphology. Diagnostic tests: Visual acuity evaluation: Every patient presenting with pseudostrabismus should have complete evaluation of visual acuity. Motor evaluation: It comprises of tests such as: Hirschbergâ€™s light reflex test: This gives a rough objective estimate of the angle of manifest strabismus and is especially useful when fixation in the deviating eye is poor. Cover-uncover test: Cover test: This is done to detect heterotropia. Uncover test: It detects heterophoria. It is performed both for near and far. Alternate cover test: It is a dissociation test which reveals the total deviation when fusion is suspended. It is performed after the cover-uncover test. Ocular movements: It is necessary to test the function of each extra-ocular muscle by testing uniocular and binocular movements. Sensory evaluation: Complete sensory evaluation may give clue to sensory development. Detection of fixation preference for one eye may be performed by vertical prism test.
#Causes - Pseudostrabismus - Q10.3
Pseudoesotropia: Pseudoesotropia is the most common type of pseudostrabismus and may be seen due to: Morphological features, Negative angle kappa, Enophthalmos. Pseudoexotropia: Pseudoexotropia may result due to: Interpupillary distance (IPD), Exophthalmos. Pseudohypertropia: Pseudohypertropia may be due to: Facial asymmetry, Orbital tumours, Trauma. Miscellaneous causes: Palpebral fissure asymmetry, Dermatochalasis , Abnormal head posture, Coloboma of iris, Anisocoria.
#Overview - Pseudostrabismus - Q10.3
Pseudostrabismus gives an appearance of strabismus (squint) when no manifest deviation of the visual axis is actually present. This apparent misalignment of the eyes is created by certain morphological features of the face, although it may be associated with certain ocular or orbital conditions. The most common form of pseudostrabismus is pseudoesotropia where the eyes appear crossed. There may be pseudoexotropia, where eyes appear to be deviated outwards and pseudohypertropia where eyes appear to be misaligned vertically.
#Riskfactor - Pseudostrabismus - Q10.3
Risk factors: Prematurity: Prematurity may cause retinopathy of prematurity which may result in temporal dragging of macula producing positive angle kappa and pseudoexotropia. Facial morphology: Prominent epicanthal folds in asian children results in pseudoesotropia. Orbital tumours: Certain orbital tumours may result in pseudohypertropia. Orbital trauma: It may produce hypoglobus resulting in pseudohypertropia in some patients. Chorioretinal infections: These may produce chorioretinal scarring with temporal dragging of macula resulting in pseudoexotropia.
#Treatment - Pseudostrabismus - Q10.3
For the common pseudoesotropia, since the nasal sclera part is being covered by the epicanthus, the orthotropic appearance may be demonstrated by pinching the nasal bridge slightly and revealing the nasal sclera. As the flat nasal bridge develops, this excessive epicanthal skin is raised and the condition corrects by itself. Hence, no treatment is required except for follow-up for disappearance of pseudoesotropia. Prognosis: The natural course of pseudostrabismus is variable. Most of the cases of pseudoesotropia resolve usually by the age of two to three years, because the epicanthal folds diminish as the bridge of the nose enlarges.
#Symptoms - Pseudostrabismus - Q10.3
Usually parents notice squint in the eyes of young child. The deviation is more noticeable when the child turns head and the eyes are in lateral gaze, especially in pseudoesotropia because nasal sclera appears buried in the epicanthal fold. Parents may bring pictures of the baby with eyes in pseudoeso- or pseudoexodeviation.
