#Diagnosis - Seasonal Allergic Conjunctivitis - 9A60.02
Diagnostic procedures: Investigations are generally not required. Intra-dermal skin test: Intra-dermal skin test is the standard clinical test for the diagnosis of type I hypersensitivity reaction. Cutaneous tests, such as the scratch, prick or patch, and more rarely, the intra-cutaneous injections, may be utilised to determine the antigens causing hypersensitivity. Superficial conjunctival scrapings: Superficial conjunctival scrapings in more active cases may help to establish the diagnosis by revealing characteristic eosinophils which are not normally present on the conjunctiva. Radio-allergo-sorbent test (RAST): Radio-allergo-sorbent test (RAST), a blood test, may also help to define the allergens. Conjunctival provocation test (CPT): Conjunctival provocation test consist of instilling offending pollen into the conjunctival sac, producing the typical symptoms of SAC. Nasal allergy test: There is also a possible involvement of nasal allergy in some patients with allergic conjunctivitis, such as SAC, and therefore, there may be value to a nasal challenge with allergen combined with registration of ocular features. Tear film mediators: Quantitative analysis of tear film inflammatory mediators is used as a disease marker and to understand immune mechanisms.
#Causes - Seasonal Allergic Conjunctivitis - 9A60.02
Acute allergy is caused by IgE-mediated MC degranulation, whereas chronic allergies are also associated with continuous activation of MC but with predominance of mediators, such as eosinophils and T- helper2 (Th2) lymphocyte-generated cytokines. Individuals with SAC have symptoms of acute allergic conjunctivitis for a defined period of time. In spring, the predominant airborne allergen is tree pollen; in summer, it is grass pollen; and in fall, it is weed pollen.
#Prevention - Seasonal Allergic Conjunctivitis - 9A60.02
Prevention involves avoidance of the offending allergen is the primary behavioural modification. Reduce amount of allergen exposure by: Avoiding outside activities: Because SAC usually involves allergens, patient should avoid outside activities until late afternoon or after a heavy rain, when pollen levels are lower. Wearing glasses or goggles: Wearing glasses or goggles can also serve as a barrier to allergens. Using air purifiers: Air purifiers that use High-efficiency particulate arrestance or high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtration are more effective and safer (remove up to 99% of the material like dust mite faeces, all allergens, such as animal dander, dust, pollen, or cockroach faeces).
#Overview - Seasonal Allergic Conjunctivitis - 9A60.02
Seasonal allergic conjunctivitis (SAC) or ‘hay fever eyes’ is an inflammatory response of the conjunctiva triggered by exposure to seasonal allergens such as pollens, animal dander (flecks of dead skin cells and hair/feathers) and other environmental antigens. The seasonal incidence of SAC is closely related to the cycles of released plant-derived airborne allergens, or aeroallergens. The allergens that produce SAC vary from one geographic area to another, but tree, grass and ragweed pollens are the most common encountered allergens.
#Treatment - Seasonal Allergic Conjunctivitis - 9A60.02
Management of SAC includes reducing the amount of allergen exposure,  Such as: Avoid outside activities, Wearing glasses or goggles, Air purifiers, Cold compresses, Saline solutions, Artificial tears, Avoidance of eye rubbing, Topical vasoconstrictors, Topical antihistamine, Combined topical vasoconstrictor and antihistamine, Systemic antihistamines, Topical second-generation H1 antihistamines, Topical mast cell stabilisers, H1 receptor blocker and mast-cell stabilizer (Dual-acting agents), Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs), Topical corticosteroids, Immune-modulators, Allergen-specific immunotherapy.
#Symptoms - Seasonal Allergic Conjunctivitis - 9A60.02
Ocular symptoms associated with SAC may be: Ocular pruritus (itching), Redness of eyes, Watering or tearing (epiphora), Mucoid discharge, Burning, Stinging or pricking, Watery discharge, Chemosis (swelling of conjunctiva), Photophobia (sensitivity to light), Swollen eyes, Dryness of eyes.
