#Diagnosis - Lymphoedema - BD93.Z
Measuring limb volume- These tests are explained below: Tape measure: A tape measure is used at 4cm (1.6in) intervals up the leg to measure the limb circumference and then calculate limb volume. Water displacement method: The water displacement method is based on the principle that helps to calculate the volume of an object by measuring how much water it displaces. Perometry: Perometry is a technique that uses infrared light to measure the volume of limb. This process can accurately calculate how swollen affected limb is. Imaging tests: Imaging tests may also be used to help in the diagnosis. These include: A Lymphoscintigraph, A Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Scan, An Ultrasound Scan.
#Causes - Lymphoedema - BD93.Z
There are two types of Lymphoedema- Primary and Secondary lymphoedema, which have different causes. Primary lymphoedema: It is due to alterations (known as mutations) in genes responsible for the development of the lymphatic system. Secondary lymphoedema: some of the common causes are: Surgical treatment of cancer, Radiotherapy, Venous diseases, Infections, Inflammation.
#Overview - Lymphoedema - BD93.Z
It is also known as Lymphatic Obstruction, is a condition of localized fluid retention and tissue swelling caused by a compromised lymphatic system. There are two main types of lymphoedema: Primary Lymphoedema – which develops at birth or after puberty and is caused by faulty genes. Secondary Lymphoedema – caused by damage to the lymphatic system as a result of an infection, injury, trauma, or cancer.
#Symptoms - Lymphoedema - BD93.Z
The main symptom of lymphoedema is swelling in all or part of a limb. Other symptoms include: the affected limb feeling heavy and aching; the affected limb losing some of its mobility; pain in the affected limb; painful joints, such as the elbow or knee, caused by swelling in the limb; repeated skin infections in the affected limb.
#Treatment - Lymphoedema - BD93.Z
The recommended treatment for lymphoedema is a treatment plan called Complex Decongestive Therapy (CDT). It is also known as Decongestive Lymphatic Therapy (DLT). There are four components to CDT treatment: Manual lymphatic drainage (MLD) is a specialized massage technique designed to stimulate the flow of fluid and reduce swelling. Multilayer lymphoedema bandaging (MLLB) uses bandages and compression garments to move fluid out of the affected limb. Remedial exercises designed to activate muscles in the limb to improve lymph drainage. Skin care is required to prevent infection.
