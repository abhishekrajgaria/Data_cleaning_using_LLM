#Causes - Postpartum Haemorrhage - JA43.Z
Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) may result from various reasons such as failure of the uterus to contract adequately (atony), genital tract trauma (vaginal or cervical lacerations), uterine rupture, retained placental tissue, or maternal bleeding disorders. Causes of primary PPH: Uterine atony, Genital trauma, Tissue, Coagulation problems. Secondary PPH is the abnormal or excessive bleeding from the birth canal between 24 hours and 12 weeks postnatally. It is often associated with infection (endometritis).
#Overview - Postpartum Haemorrhage - JA43.Z
Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) is a complication of delivery and the most common cause of maternal death, accounting for about 35% of all maternal deaths worldwide. These deaths have a major impact on the lives and health of the families affected. PPH is a major cause of morbidity and mortality with in the first 24 hours following delivery and this is regarded as primary PPH; whereas any excessive bleeding from the birth canal occurring between 24 hours and 12 weeks postnatally (after delivery) is termed as secondary PPH. PPH may result from failure of the uterus to contract adequately (atony), genital tract trauma (vaginal or cervical lacerations), uterine rupture, retained placental tissue, or maternal bleeding disorders. Uterine atony is the most common cause and consequently the leading cause of maternal mortality worldwide.
#Symptoms - Postpartum Haemorrhage - JA43.Z
The usual presentation of PPH is one of heavy vaginal bleeding that can quickly lead to signs and symptoms of hypovolemic shock. Signs of hypovolemic shock resulting from blood loss: Fall in blood pressure (BP), (BP may be normal initially), Palpitations, tachycardia, dizziness, Weakness, sweating, Restlessness, pallor, Oliguria (reduced urine volume).
#Diagnosis - Postpartum Haemorrhage - JA43.Z
Diagnosis of PPH is usually performed by closely observing the pregnant women during child birth and afterwards. Investigations: Complete blood count for diagnosis of anaemia during antenatal period and labour. Blood typing and antibody screening tests during antenatal period. Coagulation studies. Antenatal ultrasound for detecting high-risk patients with predisposing factors for PPH. Clinical examination during third stage of labour: Assessment of uterine tone and size. Manual exploration of uterus for placenta and membranes. Inspection of cervix and vagina for any injury. Additional investigations for diagnosis of secondary PPH include: High and low vaginal swabs. Full blood count. C-reactive protein.
#Prevention - Postpartum Haemorrhage - JA43.Z
The prevention and treatment of PPH are vital steps towards improving the health care of women during childbirth and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. All adolescents should be given health education to realize their rights to health, well-being, education and full and equal participation in society. During pregnancy, each pregnant woman should be investigated for anaemia and treated appropriately as this may reduce the occurrence and morbidity associated with PPH. Risk factors for PPH may present antenatally or intrapartum; hence birth preparedness and complication readiness (BPCR) plan must be prepared and may be modified as and when risk factors arise. Pregnant women and her relatives should be encouraged for institutional delivery. PPH need to be reduced by strengthening peripheral delivery facilities, active third stage management and early referral.
#Treatment - Postpartum Haemorrhage - JA43.Z
Treatment of Postpartum haemorrhage: Initial assessment is performed and basic treatment should be instituted as follows: Call for help, Assess airway, breathing, circulation (ABC), Provide supplementary oxygen, Obtain intravenous line, Start fluid replacement with intravenous crystalloid fluid, Monitor blood pressure, pulse and respiration, Catheterize bladder and monitor urinary output, Assess need for blood transfusion, Start intravenous oxytocin infusion, Order laboratory tests-complete blood count, coagulation screen, blood grouping and cross-match.
