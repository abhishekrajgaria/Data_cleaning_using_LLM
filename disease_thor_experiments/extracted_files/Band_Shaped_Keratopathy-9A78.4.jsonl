#Causes - Band Shaped Keratopathy - 9A78.4
Numerous mechanisms, whether systemic or local to the eye, by which the balance of the calcium phosphate solubility product are tilted toward abnormal tissue calcification resulting nonspecific finding of band keratopathy. As such, there are many diseases associated with this condition. Though we tend to think first of conditions such as uveitis and systemic hypercalcaemia, in a recent series the most commonly associated causes of calcific band keratopathy were chronic corneal oedema, phthisis bulbi, and even idiopathic cases.
#Diagnosis - Band Shaped Keratopathy - 9A78.4
Diagnosis of band shaped keratopathy depends upon clinical presentation. Clinical history: Patients with band shaped keratopathy are asymptomatic in the early stages of the disease. Symptomatic patients should be enquired about the severity and duration of symptoms. Laboratory diagnosis: Laboratory diagnosis may include tests to diagnose any systemic association of band shaped keratopathy such as: Serum calcium and phosphate levels. Serum parathormone level. Renal function tests viz. blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels. Angiotensin converting enzyme levels, x-ray or spiral computerised tomography (CT) scan of chest may be done in suspected cases of sarcoid.
#Overview - Band Shaped Keratopathy - 9A78.4
Band Shaped Keratopathy (Calcific band keratopathy, or band keratopathy) is a non-specific corneal condition characterised by chronic deposition of calcium salts (principally hydroxyapatite) within the basement membrane, Bowman’s layer and anterior stromal lamellae of the corneal epithelium (leaving remainder of the cornea clear). Initially, corneal degenerative changes begin near the limbus, either on nasal, temporal or both sides together in exposed palpebral fissure at 3 to 9 o’clock position. Calcific band is concentric with the limbus but is separated from it by a clear zone (representing a lucid interval) due to lack of Bowman’s layer at the periphery, or due to buffering action at the limbus. Keratopathy appears as a superficial greyish-white corneal opacity having frosted or ground glass appearance. The opacity is covered by clear epithelium with lacunae of uninvolved tissue. There are numerous holes where corneal nerves penetrate the Bowman’s layer. The disease progresses toward the corneal center and thickens as well in its anterior and posterior dimensions, resulting in more opaque, whitish surface with increased nodularity.
#Symptoms - Band Shaped Keratopathy - 9A78.4
Patients with band shaped keratopathy are asymptomatic in the early stages of the disease. Patients with band shaped keratopathy may complain of: Ocular (eye) irritation. Foreign body sensation. Diminution of vision. Lacrimation or watering of eyes. Pain. Epithelial defects. Photophobia (increased sensitivity to light). Visible plaque in the eye. Redness (less common).
#Treatment - Band Shaped Keratopathy - 9A78.4
Management should be carried out under medical supervision. Medical therapy: Although medical therapy is ineffective in treating band keratopathy, underlying systemic conditions associated with elevated levels of calcium and phosphate should be treated to prevent recurrence. Surgical therapy: The goal of surgery is to remove opaque plaques of calcium, without inducing visually significant stromal scarring. Superficial debridement: The primary goal of superficial debridement is to clear the visual axis. Superficial debridement of band keratopathy can be performed in a sterile manner in outpatient setting preferably under magnification. Though, any local anaesthesia (e.g. proparacaine) may be used, but cocaine as local anaesthetic facilitates the separation of corneal epithelium from Bowman’s layer. This allows ethylenediaminetetra acetic acid (EDTA) to work more effectively.
