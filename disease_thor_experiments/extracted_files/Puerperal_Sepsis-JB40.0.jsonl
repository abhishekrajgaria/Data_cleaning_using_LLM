#Causes - Puerperal Sepsis - JB40.0
Puerperal sepsis is bacterial infection of the genital tract which occurs after the birth of a baby. Some of the most common bacteria causing puerperal sepsis are streptococci, staphylococci, escherichia coli (E.coli), clostridium tetani, clostridium welchii, chlamydia and gonococci (bacteria which cause sexually transmitted diseases). More than one type of bacteria may be involved in puerperal sepsis. Bacteria may be either nosocomial, endogenous or exogenous. Nosocomial infections are acquired in hospitals or other health facilities and may come from the hospital environment or from the patient's own flora. Endogenous bacteria- These bacteria are normally present in the vagina and rectum without causing any disease (e.g. some types of streptococci and staphylococci, E.coli, clostridium welchii). Exogenous bacteria-These bacteria are introduced into the vagina from the outside by unclean hands and unsterile instruments, sexually transmitted infections, foreign substances inserted in to vagina.
#Overview - Puerperal Sepsis - JB40.0
Puerperal sepsis is an infective condition in the mother following childbirth. It is the third most common cause of maternal death worldwide as a result of child birth after haemorrhage and abortion. In low and middle income countries puerperal infections are the sixth leading cause of disease burden in women during their reproductive years. Puerperal sepsis can cause long-term health problems such as chronic pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and infertility in females.
#Prevention - Puerperal Sepsis - JB40.0
Identification of risk factors, universal precautions for prevention of infection, and identification of symptoms and signs at early stage can significantly control and prevent puerperal sepsis. Antenatal care- During routine antenatal care health care provider can recognize various risk factors and respond appropriately. Intrapartum care- Supervised hospital delivery should be encouraged in order to prevent puerperal sepsis. Post partum management- Infection after childbirth can be eliminated if good hygiene is practiced and if early signs of infection are recognized and treated in timely manner complications can be prevented.
#Treatment - Puerperal Sepsis - JB40.0
The objective of management in puerperal sepsis is to make an early diagnosis, treat, prevent complications, and consequently to improve quality of life. Isolation and barrier nursing care-Basic principle of care in puerperal sepsis cases is preventing the spread of infection to other women and their babies by providing isolation and barrier nursing care. Administration of antibiotics- A combination of antibiotics is given until the woman is fever-free for 48 hours. Tetanus toxoid- If there is uncertainty about tetanus vaccination, it should be given. Plenty of fluids- Fluids are given to correct or prevent dehydration and help to lower the fever. Ruling out retained placental fragments- Retained placental fragments can be a cause of puerperal sepsis. Care of the newborn- Unless the mother is very ill, the newborn can safely stay with her.
#Complication - Puerperal Sepsis - JB40.0
Puerperal sepsis may be localized in the perineum, vagina, cervix or uterus. In severe cases, it can extend beyond the uterus to involve the fallopian tubes and ovaries, to the pelvic cellular tissue causing parametritis, to the pelvic peritoneum, causing peritonitis and into the blood stream causing septicaemia. Pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility may be delayed complications of the puerperal sepsis.
#Diagnosis - Puerperal Sepsis - JB40.0
General history and clinical examination of women after child birth are important steps in assessing the post partum complications. Vital signs such as temperature, pulse, respiration, blood pressure, and examination of breast, abdomen, perineum, legs; lochia (discharge after child birth) should be examined carefully. Laboratory investigation: Complete blood count; Urinalysis, with culture and sensitivity tests; Electrolytes estimation; Cervical or uterine cultures; Blood culture, if sepsis is suspected; Coagulation studies-In pelvic thrombosis, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or invasive treatment (eg, surgical procedure) is being considered; Pelvic ultrasonography may be helpful in detecting retained products of conception, pelvic abscess, or infected hematoma; Contrast-enhanced CT or MRI are useful in establishing the diagnosis of septic pelvic thrombosis.
#Riskfactor - Puerperal Sepsis - JB40.0
Some women are more vulnerable to puerperal sepsis, including: Prolonged/obstructed  labour; multiple vaginal examinations in labour (more than five); premature ruptured membranes; caesarean section (CS); obstetrical manoeuvres; post-partum haemorrhage; pre-existing sexually transmitted infections; unrepaired cervical lacerations, or large vaginal lacerations; unhygienic practices during labour; prolonged retention of dead fetus, retained fragments of placenta or membranes; obesity; low socio-economic status; poor nutrition; primiparity; anaemia, diabetes.
#Symptoms - Puerperal Sepsis - JB40.0
Puerperal sepsis was defined as infection of the genital tract occurring at any time between the onset of rupture of membranes or labour, and the 42nd day postpartum in which two or more of the following symptoms and signs may be present: fever (temperature of 38Â°C or more) with chills and general malaise, lower abdominal pain, tenderness lower abdomen, Delay in the rate of reduction of the size of the uterus (involution)(<2cm/day during first eight days), Purulent foul-smelling lochia,  light vaginal bleeding, shock.
