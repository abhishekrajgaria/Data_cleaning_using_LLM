#Causes - Ramsay Hunt Syndrome - 8B88.Y
Ramsay Hunt syndrome is caused due to reactivation of Varicella zoster virus (VZV) lying dormant in geniculate ganglion. Primary infection with Varicella zoster virus (VZV), known as varicella or chickenpox is a common erythematous infection of the paediatric age group. VZV remains dormant in cranial nerve neurons and dorsal root ganglia. Subsequent reactivation, more so during periods of stress, may result in prodromal period of severe pain followed by localised vesicular rash, known as herpes zoster infection.
#Symptoms - Ramsay Hunt Syndrome - 8B88.Y
Commonly, Ramsay Hunt syndrome is a disease affecting elderly people or someone with immune deficiency. However, it may be seen in younger patients under conditions of stress. Symptoms may include: Paroxysmal pain deep within the ear, which precedes rashes, Herpetiform eruptions, Impaired hearing, Vertigo, Facial nerve palsy, Loss of sensation of taste in anterior two third of tongue, Nystagmus.
#Diagnosis - Ramsay Hunt Syndrome - 8B88.Y
Diagnosis of Ramsay Hunt syndrome is based upon the clinical history of otalgia associated with vesicular lesions or eschars, and facial paralysis. Histology: There is swelling and inflammation of the ganglion of affected cranial nerve with VZV. Inflammation is predominantly lymphocytic in nature. Some cells of the ganglion show swelling and others may be degenerated. Investigations: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI): Magnetic Resonance Imaging shows enhancement of a large portion of facial nerve. Brainstem auditory evoked response: Brainstem auditory evoked response shows significant increase in latencies of certain waves, and also inter-peak latencies in others. Saliva: VZV DNA level in saliva helps to understand viral reactivation in facial nerve and oropharyngeal epithelium. Cerebrospinal fluid: Real time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) of CSF may be done to diagnose this virus.
#Overview - Ramsay Hunt Syndrome - 8B88.Y
Ramsay-Hunt Syndrome or Herpes zoster oticus is a syndrome characterised by acute otalgia, herpetic vesicular rash associated with facial palsy. This is the second most common cause of facial paralysis and is due to reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus that remains dormant/latent in the geniculate ganglion after primary infection with chickenpox. Characteristic presentation is severe acute otalgia with unilateral facial paralysis. Vesicular eruptions if not present initially, may appear usually within three to five days.
#Treatment - Ramsay Hunt Syndrome - 8B88.Y
Treatment includes: Medical therapy: Combination of steroids and antiviral agents: Use of Combination of steroids and antiviral agents have shown a higher recovery rate. Prognosis: With early onset of medical therapy within three days, almost or complete resolution is seen in most of the cases. Cases missing indicative cutaneous symptoms (zoster sine herpete), but showing combination of otalgia, sensorineural hearing loss, vertigo or any kind of facial paresis, raises suspicion of Ramsay Hunt syndrome.
