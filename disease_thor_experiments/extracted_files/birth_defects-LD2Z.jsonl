#Diagnosis - birth defects - LD2Z
For the detection of congenital anomalies screening can be done during preconception period, during pregnancy and after child birth. Preconception screening: to identify those at risk of conceiving a child with a birth defect since inherited disorders tend to cluster within families. Peri-conception screening: offering genetic counseling to women 35 years or older. Along with routine ultrasound other tests can be used for screening during the first trimester and the second trimester of pregnancy. Nuchhal translucency test: with the help of ultrasound thickness of the area at the back of the neck (foetus) is measured. An increase in the thickness can be a sign of Down syndrome. First trimester blood test: high levels of beta human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) hormone and low levels of pregnancy associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A) are related with certain birth defects. Triple screen test/ quad screening: The triple screen test is a maternal blood screening test that involves three specific substances: Alpha-fetoprotein test (AFP), human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG), and estriol estimation. Anomaly Ultrasound: The ultrasound is used to know about different parameters of foetus and looks for any birth defects. Amniocentesis: during pregnancy foetus is surrounded by amniotic fluid that can be used to detect genetic disorders in the foetus. Chorionic villus sampling (CVS): in this test cells from the chorionic villi (tissues from placenta) are examined for chromosomal disorders such as Down syndromes. Cell-free fetal DNA: It is a noninvasive prenatal screening that uses cell-free DNA from the plasma of pregnant women as a screening method for fetal aneuploidy. Cordocentesis: also called percutaneous umbilical blood sampling, a small sample of the foetal blood is withdrawn from the umbilical cord for detection of foetal abnormalities after 17 weeks of pregnancy.
#Causes - birth defects - LD2Z
Approximately in 50 percent of birth defects a specific cause is not known. However, known causes can be divided broadly into two groups: Preconception causes: are genetic and partially genetic, originating mostly before conception. Birth defects are due to abnormalities of the genetic material--chromosomes and genes including chromosomal abnormalities, single gene defects and multifactorial disorders (which are caused by the interaction of genes and the environment). Post-conception causes: develop after conception, but before birth. Birth defect is caused by an intra-uterine environmental factor. This includes teratogens that interfere with normal growth and development of the embryo or foetus, mechanical forces that deform the foetus, and vascular accidents that disrupt the normal growth of organs.
#Overview - birth defects - LD2Z
Congenital anomalies (birth defects) can be defined as structural or functional anomalies (e.g. metabolic disorders) that occur during intrauterine life and can be identified prenatally, at birth or later in life. Congenital anomalies are also known as birth defects, congenital disorders or congenital malformations. Congenital anomalies are the major cause of new born deaths within four weeks of birth and can result in long-term disability with a significant impact on individuals, families, societies and health-care systems. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2010, an estimated 270 000 deaths during the first 28 days of life were reported due to congenital anomalies globally. According to March of Dimes (MOD) global report on birth defects 7.9 million births (6% of total births) occur annually worldwide with serious birth defects and 94% of these births occur in the middle and low income countries. According to joint WHO and MOD meeting report, birth defects account for 7% of all neonatal mortality and 3.3 million under five deaths. The prevalence of birth defects in India is 6-7% which translates to around 1.7 million birth defects annually. The common birth defects include congenital heart disease (8-10 per 1000 live births), congenital deafness (5.6-10 per 1000 live births), and neural tube defects (4-11.4 per 1000 live births) (March of Dimes report, 2006). Some birth defects are clinically apparent at birth; others may only be diagnosed later in life. The structural defect such as spina bifida is obvious at birth whereas haemophilia a functional defect (a bleeding disorder) is not usually obvious until infancy or childhood. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India has addressed the problem with the implementation of various national health programmes. In 2013, National Child Health Screening and Early Intervention Services covered 30 health conditions of the children aged 0-18 years through various approaches. India Newborn Action Plan (INAP) formulated in September 2014, has integrated the approaches for the prevention and care of newborn with birth defects into primary health care, with an emphasis on maternal and child health. INAP is Indiaâ€™s committed response to the Global Every Newborn Action Plan (ENAP) by WHO with a vision to eliminate preventable newborn deaths and stillbirths.
#Prevention - birth defects - LD2Z
Primary prevention is an important aspect in the prevention of congenital anomalies. It aims to ensure that individuals are born free of birth defects by being conceived normally and not being damaged in the foetal life. This can be achieved with basic reproductive health approaches which include family welfare services, promoting healthy dietary habits and lifestyle, safe food and environment; detecting, treating and preventing maternal infections; control of such diseases as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and epilepsy; vaccination, avoiding use of certain drugs during pregnancy and prior to conception (in women planning for the pregnancy).

#Risk factors - birth defects - LD2Z
Socioeconomic and demographic factors: Congenital anomalies are more frequently seen among low income families and countries. About 94% of severe congenital anomalies occur in low- and middle-income countries due to poor access to sufficient and healthy food, increased exposure to various infections and alcohol (cause foetal alcohol syndrome) and insufficient health care delivery system. Maternal age: advanced maternal age increases the risk of chromosomal abnormalities, such as Down syndrome.
#Treatment - birth defects - LD2Z
Management includes: Neonatal screening including physical examination of all neonates and screening for functional disorders such as congenital hypothyroidism, phenylketonuria, sickle-cell disease and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency by trained primary health care providers can be performed. Neonates with birth defects may be further referred to appropriate level of medical/surgical facilities. Effective life-saving medical treatment is available for several birth defects with functional disorders such as thalassaemia (inherited recessive blood disorders), sickle cell disorders and congenital hypothyroidism (reduced function of the thyroid). Many structural congenital anomalies (about 50%) can be corrected with paediatric surgery in early life, such as simple congenital heart defects, cleft lip and palate, club foot, congenital cataracts, and gastrointestinal and urogenital abnormalities. Simple, cost-effective, and non-invasive treatment also exists for certain conditions such as clubfoot.   Appropriate treatment is also needed for congenital disorders manifesting themselves after the neonatal period. This includes the early detection and treatment with rehabilitation services. Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW), Government of India has made a provision for prevention, early diagnosis and management of birth defects under India Newborn Action Plan (INAP), 2014 along with basic mother and child care.
