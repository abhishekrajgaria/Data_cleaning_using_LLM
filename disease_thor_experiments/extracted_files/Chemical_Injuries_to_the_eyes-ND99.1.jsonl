#Causes - Chemical Injuries to the eyes - ND99.1
More than 25,000 chemical products with the potential to cause chemical eye injuries have been identified, many of which may be classified as acids or bases, oxidising or reducing agents, or corrosives. Acids and bases are the most frequently implicated chemical agents. The severity of the injury is related to the nature, concentration, quantity and pH of the chemical involved. Alkalis: Most common causes of alkali injury to the eye are lye, potassium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, lime, wet/dry cement and ammonia. Ammonia (NH3): Ammonia (NH3) is available as a fertiliser and refrigerant, and is used in the manufacture of other chemicals. Ammonium hydroxide ranks high in severity in causing injuries to eyes. Lye: Lye, caustic soda or sodium hydroxide (NaOH), penetrates into the interior of the eye in 3-5 minutes. Solid sodium hydroxide, often used as a drain cleaner, can cause pressure to develop within the drainpipe, resulting in an explosion of lye into the face and eyes. Potassium hydroxide (KOH): Potassium hydroxide (KOH) or caustic potash penetrates the eye slightly less rapidly than sodium hydroxide.
#Complications - Chemical Injuries to the eyes - ND99.1
Potential complications and sequelae of chemical injuries to the eye are: Lids: Posterior displacement of meibomian orifices. Trichiasis. Cicatricial ectropion. Cicatricial entropion. Lagophthalmos (inability to close the eyelids completely). Ankyloblepharon (adhesion of eyelids to each other). Ocular surface: Dry eye. Loss of goblet cells. Damage to lacrimal system. Corneal scarring. Corneal neovascularisation. Limbal stem cell deficiency. Symblepharon. Corneal melt. Corneal opacity. Intraocular inflammation. Recurrent corneal erosions. Non healing epithelial defects. Microbial keratitis. Elevated IOP: Secondary glaucoma. Intraocular structures: Fixed dilated pupil. Iris ischaemia. Ciliary body shut down with secondary hypotony (reduced intraocular pressure). Cataract. Retinal detachment. Phthisis bulbi (shrunken globe).
#Overview - Chemical Injuries to the eyes - ND99.1
Chemical Injuries to the Eye constitutes an ophthalmic emergency, due to the potential for permanent visual impairment and threat to the structural integrity of the eye. Severe injury may result in widespread damage to the ocular surface epithelium. Chemical injuries cause tissue destruction created from a wave of strongly dissociated ions flooding the eyelid and/or tear film and reservoir, penetrating the cornea and adjacent tissues, thereby reaching to the aqueous humour. Immediate shrinkage of the collagenous envelope of the eye results in a rapid rise in intraocular pressure, followed by a second rise which lasts longer and is produced by prostaglandin release. At any time, rise in pressure can occur due to clogging of the trabecular meshwork by necrotic debris, and from organisation of inflammatory components, followed by cicatricial closure of the chamber angle, especially inferiorly.
#Diagnosis - Chemical Injuries to the eyes - ND99.1
Diagnosis requires: Clinical history: Patient should be asked for: When the injury occurred. Whether the eye was rinsed and for how long. Mechanism of injury (was the chemical under pressure). The nature of chemical. Whether there was any eye protection or not. Clinical grading of chemical Injuries: Epithelial defect: Measure the size and draw the shape of the defect after instilling 2% fluorescein dye. Include any conjunctival epithelial defects as well, particularly concerning the palisades of Vogt (limbal stem cells). Perilimbal ischaemia: To document perilimbal ischaemia, note the clock hours where the conjunctiva is whitened. The conjunctiva and episclera are devoid of blood vessels in these areas. Adnexa: Measure and document the blinking pattern, corneal exposure, and/or lagophthalmos. Differential diagnosis: Thermal burns to the eyes. Ultraviolet radiation keratitis. Other causes of corneal opacification. Ocular cicatricial pemphigoid.
#Symptoms - Chemical Injuries to the eyes - ND99.1
Most common immediate symptoms are: Severe pain. Red eyes. Watering or epiphora. Foreign body sensation. Blurring of vision. Reduced visual acuity. Photophobia (increased sensitivity to light). Blepharospasm (sustained involuntary closure of eyelids).
#Prevention - Chemical Injuries to the eyes - ND99.1
Education and training regarding prevention of chemical exposures in the workplace can help in preventing chemical injuries to the eye. For general prevention, safety glasses may be used to safeguard eyes. Even these measures may not suffice in high-velocity (explosive) chemical injury.
#Treatment - Chemical Injuries to the eyes - ND99.1
Management should be carried out under medical supervision. Preparation for vision restoration: Preparation for vision restoration must begin immediately after the injury. Deliberate and timely treatment determines successful outcomes in the rehabilitative process. In succession, management consists of emergency treatment, pressure control, suppression of inflammation, enhancing stromal repair, and establishing eyelid-globe congruity during the early days, weeks, and months after the injury. Medical therapy: Emergency management: Irrigation of eyes: Emergency management requires prompt irrigation and the removal of residual chemical debris from the eye. The objectives are to minimise penetration of the chemical into the anterior chamber, and to remove a potential reservoir for ongoing injury. Aqueous humour replacement: External irrigation is of limited value in eliminating chemicals once they have reached the anterior chamber. Role of paracentesis (removal of aqueous from anterior chamber) and irrigation of the anterior chamber is controversial. Corticosteroid therapy: Intensive corticosteroid therapy during first two weeks decreases the inflammatory response (which can delay epithelial migration), and thus enhances re-epithelialisation. Medroxyprogesterone: Medroxyprogesterone is a pogestational steroid that has weak anti- inflammatory activity as compared to corticosteroids.
