#Causes - Chalcosis - 9A78.1
Copper containing foreign bodies are the most common non-magnetic foreign bodies. Copper diffuses within the eye in its ionised form. Foreign bodies containing more than 85% copper typically form diffuse deposits, whereas foreign bodies with lower copper content usually causes more localised response. Copper has affinity for intraocular basement membranes e.g. Descemet’s membrane and Lens capsule. Causes of Chalcosis includes: Penetrating ocular injuries, Wilson’s disease (hepato-lenticular degeneration).
#Complications - Chalcosis - 9A78.1
Complications may be: Retained intraocular foreign body. Retained intraocular foreign body may lead to progressive diminution of vision, defect in visual field, colour vision, dark adaptometry and electroretinogram. Intraocular inflammation. Intraocular deposition of copper. There may be development of ocular hypotony, cataract, and uveitis.
#Diagnosis - Chalcosis - 9A78.1
Laboratory tests: Visual field. Electroretinogram. Dark adaptometry, if required. B- scan ultrasonography to define status of vitreous and retina. Computed tomography to localise a foreign body. Radiographic spectrometry to check for the presence of intraocular copper ions.
#Overview - Chalcosis - 9A78.1
Chalcosis or chalcosis bulbi refers to mild ocular inflammation due to an intraocular foreign body containing copper between about 70 to 85%. Chalcosis results in deposition of copper on lens capsule (sunflower cataract), Descemet’s membrane (Kayser- Fleischer ring), iris (green discolouration), sluggish pupillary response, vitreous degeneration and liquefaction, yellow retinal plaques and degeneration. The intensity of inflammatory response due to copper containing foreign body depends upon the copper content. It may lead to: Severe endophthalmitis if copper content is more than 85%, Chalcosis if less than 85% Foreign body containing less than 70% is relatively inert in the eye. Chalcosis may be acute or chronic.
#Symptoms - Chalcosis - 9A78.1
Symptoms vary according to the size, location and content of copper in intraocular foreign body. There may be no reaction, if the copper content is less than 70%. The most intense reactions are associated with copper content more than 85%. Larger foreign bodies offer more surface area from which to liberate copper ion. A foreign body in mid- vitreous may not incite inflammation or it may be quietly encapsulated. Locations near vascularised retina and ciliary body are more prone to incite inflammation. Acute Chalcosis presents rapidly with: Inflammation, Deteriorating vision, Hypotony, Retinal detachment.
#Prevention - Chalcosis - 9A78.1
Prevention involves use of protective eyewear designed to reduce ocular injuries.
#Treatment - Chalcosis - 9A78.1
Management involves: Systemic therapy: Prophylaxis for endophthalmitis should be given. Oral steroids suppress inflammatory response. Initial local therapy: Initial therapy involves closure of an open Eyeball due to injury. Surgical therapy: Foreign bodies with copper content of 85% or more may incite acute inflammatory response. It requires prompt removal of foreign body. Vitrectomy with or without lensectomy and scleral buckle may be done. Peribulbar dexamethasone suppresses both inflammation and encapsulation of intraocular copper.
