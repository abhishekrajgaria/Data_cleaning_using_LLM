#Overview - Exotropia - 9C80.1
Childhood exotropia (outward deviation) is a horizontal exodeviation characterised by visual axis forming a divergent angle. It usually begins as exophoria. Exophoria is a condition in which eyes are straight without deviation when both eyes are open. However, eye under cover deviates on cover-uncover test or alternate cover test. It may progress to exotropia which may be latent (exophoria) or manifest (Exotropia). Fluctuation between phoria and tropia is common in exotropia. Classification of childhood exotropia: It is broadly classified as: Intermittent exotropia. Constant exotropia: Constant exotropia may be of following types: Congenital exotropia, Decompensated intermittent exotropia, Sensory deprivation exotropia, Consecutive exotropia.
#Diagnosis - Exotropia - 9C80.1
For diagnosis of childhood exotropia:- A complete eye examination is conducted including record of ocular motility. Intermittent exotropia: Patients with intermittent exotropia rarely have any complaints due to well developed suppression mechanism. Patient may have symptoms like eyestrain, headache, blurring of vision or difficulty in prolonged reading. Congenital Exotropia: It is characterised by:- Fairly large and constant angle of deviation. Infant has normal refraction. Adduction is not restricted. Decompensated intermittent exotropia: In some patients, exophoria progresses to intermittent exotropia that eventually may lead to constant exotropia. Sensory deprivation exotropia: An eye with poor vision (may be due to opaque media), or a blind eye drifts outwards into exodeviation. This usually occurs in children 2 to 4 years of age and in adults. Consecutive exotropia: Development of consecutive exotropia, after correction of esotropia, may take many years.
#Treatment - Exotropia - 9C80.1
Nonsurgical methods of correction are adopted in children having good control of deviation as well as in those where risks of overcorrection are undesirable. Correction of refractive errors. Prescription of overcorrecting concave (minus) glasses. Part time occlusion. Use of prisms. Orthoptic treatment. Botulinum toxin chemodenervation. In sensory deprivation exotropia, management involves elimination or reversal of treatable causes like removal of cataract. Surgical management of exotropia: Surgical management may be indicated in patients with: Poor control of intermittent exotropia. Progressive deterioration of control of intermittent exotropia. Severe eyestrain. Troublesome diplopia.
#Symptoms - Exotropia - 9C80.1
Patient with Childhood exotropia may present with:- Patient may experience eyestrain following prolonged near work. Running together of words or missing of the word being read, due to divergence of eyes. Some patients may be aware of divergence and are able to control it voluntarily. Voluntary control of exodeviation may lead to accommodative convergence which makes letter appear small in size. Some patients have panoramic view i.e. increase in temporal visual field. A child may close one eye (eye which diverges) in bright light.
#Causes - Exotropia - 9C80.1
Heredity appears to have role in exodeviation. The cause of exodeviation is thought to be multi-factorial. However, successive generations in a family tend to have exotropia earlier and of greater severity.
