#Complication - Orbital Lymphangioma - LA90.12
Complications may be: Disfigurement, Optic neuropathy due to pressure by the tumour or haemorrhagic cyst, Strabismus, Ptosis, Orbital bone asymmetry due to pressure by the tumour, Amblyopia.
#Causes - Orbital Lymphangioma - LA90.12
Lymphangioma is likely to be derived from vascular mesenchyme that has differentiated abnormaly into isolated lymphatic- like spaces with no connection to the systemic circulation. They are benign hamartomatous vascular tumours, which differ from haemangiomas in that they do not display proliferating endothelial cells. Lymphangiomas are usually located in the head and neck region and may involve eyelid, conjunctiva, and orbit.
#Overview - Orbital Lymphangioma - LA90.12
Orbital Lymphangioma is an intra-orbital, non-encapsulated, congenital vascular tumour with a propensity for recurrent haemorrhage. Lymphangioma is a benign vascular hamartoma commonly noticed in head and neck area. Lymphangioma is a common vascular tumour in children and commonly presents in age group less than ten years. Like haemangiomas, Lymphangiomas may present in both superficial and deep orbital spaces. It consists of dilated, thin walled vascular chambers lined with endothelium. There are micro-cystic, macro-cystic, or mixed types of Lymphangiomas.
#Diagnosis - Orbital Lymphangioma - LA90.12
Histopathology: Lymphangioma is a histologically benign but clinically aggressive tumour. Histopathologically, there are non-encapsulated, thin walled, endothelium lined channels and cystic vascular spaces which may contain fluid resembling lymph. Imaging studies: Ultrasonography: Ultrasonography lacks specificity and soft tissue details. It identifies soft tissue and cystic components of the lesion. Computed tomography: Computed tomography best delineates bony deformity produced by long-standing lesions. Magnetic resonance imaging: Magnetic resonance imaging provides superior quality soft tissue details. Identification of cystic structures and blood serum interfaces are diagnostic of the lesion.
#Symptoms - Orbital Lymphangioma - LA90.12
Patient may present with symptoms such as Proptosis, which may be slowly progressive or sudden and painful, Cutaneous blood filled cysts in superficial lesions, Conjunctival haemorrhage or chemosis, in superficially located tumours, Ptosis (drooping of upper eyelid), Strabismus, mainly if tumour is large and infiltrative, Optic neuropathy, Vascular lesions in oral mucosa, in deeply situated lesions with frequent intracranial component.
#Treatment - Orbital Lymphangioma - LA90.12
Treatment includes: Supportive therapy: Since management of lymphangioma is difficult, it is advisable to observe it initially. Medical therapy: Oral corticosteroids may help in the acute phase to resolve the lymphoid infiltration. Surgical therapy: Surgery is, generally avoided since manipulation of the tumour may promote further spontaneous haemorrhage. Surgical procedures are: Cyst drainage, De-bulking of tumour, Carbon dioxide laser. Prognosis: The majority of patients present in the first decade of life. It shows either slow or explosive growth patterns.
