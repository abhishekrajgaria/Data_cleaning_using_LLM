#Symptoms - Maternal anemia - KA00.B
Early symptoms of anemia are usually nonspecific such as fatigue, weakness, light-headedness, mild dyspnea during exertion. Other symptoms and signs may include pallor of the eyelids, tongue, nail beds, and palms, spoon-shaped nails (koilonychia), and oedema. The restless leg syndrome during pregnancy and pica (an eating disorder to lick or eat non-food items, such as gypsum, chalk, soil, ice or paper) are also prevalent symptoms in pregnant women. Tachycardia, hypotension and even congestive cardiac failure can occur in severe cases.
#Treatment - Maternal anemia - KA00.B
As the need for iron increases during pregnancy, prophylactic oral iron therapy is given to all pregnant women with normal laboratory values. Vitamin supplementation- Vitamin B12 and Vitamin C supplementation is also given along with iron supplementation. Diet counselling-All the mothers should be encouraged to take iron rich foods and avoid coffee and tea just after meals.
#Prevention - Maternal anemia - KA00.B
Anaemia is a multi-factorial disorder that requires a multi-pronged approach for its prevention. As most women start their pregnancy with low iron stores and anaemia, preventive interventions should start early in life specially with adolescent girls and women in child bearing age. Good nutrition is the best way to prevent anemia. Nutrition education programmes should be strengthened in the community/ health care facilities with the objective to improve the amount and bioavailability of iron in Indian diet. Family should be made aware about the different plans to meet the requirement of iron rich foods, role of iron inhibitors and enhancers in the diet with changing dietary habits according to various cultural, agricultural and socio-economic environment in the country. Preventive measures include nutrition education about increase iron intake through food-based approaches namely- dietary diversification, food fortification with iron, iron supplementation; and improved health services and sanitation.
#Risk factors - Maternal anemia - KA00.B
Anemia increases risk of preterm delivery. Postpartum anaemia is associated with decreased quality of life, including increased tiredness, breathlessness, palpitations and infections. Women who have postpartum anemia may also experience greater stress and depression and may be less responsive towards their infants.
#Diagnosis - Maternal anemia - KA00.B
Diagnosis of anemia during pregnancy is done by the symptoms, clinical signs and investigations. Hemoglobin estimation (Hb)- Haemoglobin estimation is the most practical method of diagnosing anemia. Mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean cell hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), red cell distribution width (RDW), reticulocyte Hb content, % hypochromic cells, and peripheral blood smear are used to detect type of anemia. Bone marrow examination is only indicated in cases where there is no response to iron therapy after 4 weeks or for diagnosis of Kala-azar or in suspected aplastic anemia.
#Overview - Maternal anemia - KA00.B
Anaemia during pregnancy is one of the important factors associated with a number of maternal and foetal complications. It decreases the woman’s reserve to tolerate bleeding either during or after child birth and makes prone to infections. Anaemia during pregnancy also has been associated with increased risk of intra uterine growth restriction, premature delivery, low birth weight (LBW) and maternal and child mortality.
#Causes - Maternal anemia - KA00.B
The common causes of anemia during pregnancy are nutritional disorders and infections. Among nutritional disorders iron deficiency is the most common cause of anaemia globally. Other conditions such as folate, vitamin B12 and vitamin A deficiency, chronic inflammation, parasitic infections, and inherited disorders can all cause anemia. Causes of nutritional anaemia in women: Iron loss during menstruation, Poor iron stores from infancy, childhood deficiencies and adolescent anaemia, Iron loss from post-partum haemorrhage, Increased iron requirement during pregnancy, Teenage pregnancy. Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA): IDA occurs when the body doesn’t have enough iron to produce adequate amounts of haemoglobin. Folate deficiency anaemia- Folate is a type of B vitamin needs to produce new cells including healthy red blood cells. Sickle cell disease and thalassemia are inherited disorders of haemoglobin result in recurrent haemolytic anaemia. Infections: Certain chronic diseases, such as cancer, HIV/AIDS, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn’s disease and other chronic inflammatory diseases can interfere with the production of RBCs, resulting in chronic anaemia. Kidney failure can also cause anaemia
