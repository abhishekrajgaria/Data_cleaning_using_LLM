#Complications - Preterm Birth - KA21.4Z
Because preterm/premature babies are not yet fully developed, they may suffer from various complications such as: Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS), Feeding difficulties, Jaundice, Severe infections (neonatal sepsis), Brain injury, Necrotizing enterocolitis, Retinopathy of prematurity, Anemia of prematurity.
#Causes - Preterm Birth - KA21.4Z
Preterm birth is a syndrome with a variety of causes which can be classified into two broad subtypes: Spontaneous preterm birth: The cause of spontaneous preterm labor cannot be unidentified in up to half of all cases. Provider-initiated preterm birth: it is defined as induction of labor or elective caesarian birth before 37 completed weeks of gestation for maternal or fetal indications , or other non-medical reasons. Most preterm births occurs spontaneously but some are due to early induction of labour or caesarean birth, whether for medical or non-medical reasons.
#Overview - Preterm Birth - KA21.4Z
Preterm birth (premature birth) is a significant public health problem across the world because of associated neonatal (first 28 days of life) mortality and short- and long-term morbidity and disability in later life. Preterm is defined by World Health Organization (WHO) as babies born alive before 37 completed weeks of gestation or fewer than 259 days of gestation since the first day of a womanâ€™s last menstrual period (LMP). Normally, a pregnancy lasts about 40 weeks. According to WHO, every year about 15 million babies are born prematurely around the world and that is more than one in 10 of all babies born globally. Almost 1 million children die each year due to complications of preterm birth (2013). Across 184 countries, the rate of preterm birth ranges from 5% to 18% of babies born. In India, out of 27 million babies born every year (2010 data), 3.5 million babies born are premature.
#Diagnosis - Preterm Birth - KA21.4Z
To date, there is no single test or sequence of assessment measures to accurately predict preterm birth. Clinical, biophysical, and biochemical tests that can be used as predictors for preterm birth are: Uterine contraction monitoring, Cervical Examination, Fetal fibronectin, Cardio-respiratory monitoring, Fluid input and output monitor, Blood tests, Echocardiogram, Ultrasound scan, Eye examination.
#Prevention - Preterm Birth - KA21.4Z
Prevention of preterm births includes improved quality of care before, between and during pregnancy to decrease occurrence of preterm birth with improved preterm birth outcomes and care of premature babies to reduce deaths and disability among them. Consideration of following factors/solutions during the preconception period can improve the health of the pregnant woman and may contribute to prevent preterm births: Prevent pregnancy in adolescence, Eat supplementation/fortification of essential foods with micronutrients, Screen for, diagnose and manage chronic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes, Promote vaccination of children and adolescents..
#Risk factors - Preterm Birth - KA21.4Z
Risk factors for preterm birth: Age at pregnancy: adolescent pregnancy and advanced maternal age; Previous preterm birth; Multiple pregnancies (such as twins, triplets); Infections and chronic conditions such as diabetes and high blood pressure; Genetic influences; Nutritional: under nutrition, obesity, micronutrient deficiencies; Life style-Women who smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol or take other recreational drugs.
#Treatment - Preterm Birth - KA21.4Z
Management of preterm birth incorporates the specialized care of women during pregnancy and child birth along with care of newborn (preterm) baby. Care during pregnancy and child birth: Use of antenatal corticosteroids, Use of antibiotics for prelabour premature rupture of membranes, Use of magnesium sulphate.
