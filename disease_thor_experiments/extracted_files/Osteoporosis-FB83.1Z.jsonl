#Diagnosis - Osteoporosis - FB83.1Z
Osteoporosis is often diagnosed after the weakening of the bones has led to a fracture. Diagnosis can be made on suspicion when patient approaches a doctor for any other reason or x-ray is done otherwise and bones appear weak. Conventional radiography: Conventional radiography is used either alone or in conjunction with CT or MRI, for detecting complications of osteopenia (reduced bone mass preosteoporosis). Dual-energy X-ray: Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of osteoporosis. Biomarkers: Chemical biomarkers are a useful tool in detecting bone degradation.
#Causes - Osteoporosis - FB83.1Z
Osteoporosis may be caused due to decrease in density of bones.
#Overview - Osteoporosis - FB83.1Z
Osteoporosis is defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a bone mineral density of 2.5 standard deviations or more below the mean peak bone mass (average of young, healthy adults) as measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. The term "established osteoporosis" includes the presence of a fragility fracture. It is a medical condition that affects the bones, causing them to become weak and fragile and more likely to break (fracture). Common form of osteoporosis: Primary Osteoporosis, Secondary Osteoporosis.
#Prevention - Osteoporosis - FB83.1Z
Regular exercises: Regular exercise is essential. Adults are advised to workout for at least 30 minutes, five times a week. Weight bearing exercises are beneficial. Healthy eating: Calcium and Vitamin D are essential for healthy bones. No smoking, No excess consumption of alcohol.
#Symptoms - Osteoporosis - FB83.1Z
Osteoporosis develops slowly over several years. Sometime a minor fall or sudden impact can cause a bone to fracture. Typical fragility fractures occur in the vertebral column, rib, hip and wrist. Symptoms include: Joint pain, Swelling, Loss of height and stooped posture, Disfigurement, A curved upper back (dowager's hump), Debilitation.
#Riskfactor - Osteoporosis - FB83.1Z
Women: Women are at greater risk of developing osteoporosis than men. This is because changes in hormone levels can affect bone density. Men: In most of the men who develop osteoporosis, the cause is unknown. However, there is a link to the male hormone testosterone, which helps to keep the bones healthy. Diseases of the hormone-producing glands There are increased chances of Osteoporosis by hormone-related diseases, including: Hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid gland), Disorders of the adrenal glands, such as Cushing's syndrome, Reduced amounts of sex hormones (oestrogen and testosterone), Disorders of the pituitary gland, Hyperparathyroidism (overactivity of the parathyroid glands). Other things thought to increase the risk of osteoporosis and broken bones include: Family history of osteoporosis, A low body mass index (BMI) of 19 or less, Long-term use of high-dose corticosteroid treatment (widely used for conditions such as arthritis and asthma), which can affect bone strength, Heavy drinking and smoking, Rheumatoid arthritis.
#Treatment - Osteoporosis - FB83.1Z
Lifestyle: Tobacco smoking and high alcohol intake have been linked with osteoporosis. Cessation of smoking and moderation of alcohol intake are commonly recommended. Nutrition: Vitamin D and calcium supplements together can result in preventing fractures. However, there is an increased risk of myocardial infarctions and kidney stones with excess of these supplements. Medications: Bisphosphonates are useful in decreasing the risk of future fractures. Teriparatide (a recombinant parathyroid hormone) has been shown to be effective in treatment of women with postmenopausal osteoporosis.
