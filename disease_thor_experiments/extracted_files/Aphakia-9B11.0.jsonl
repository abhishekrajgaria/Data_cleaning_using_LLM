#Causes - Aphakia - 9B11.0
Causes of aphakia are Surgical aphakia: Surgical aphakia is the commonest type and is produced after removal of the crystalline lens. Congenital absence of lens: There may be congenital absence of lens. It is a rare condition. Absorption of lens matter: Rarely, absorption of lens matter may be seen after trauma in children. Traumatic extrusion of lens: Rarely, there may be traumatic extrusion of lens from the eye leading to aphakia. Posterior dislocation of lens: Posterior dislocation of lens in to the vitreous may cause optical aphakia. Heritable disorders associated with dislocated lenses: These may be Marfan’s syndrome, Weil-Marchesani syndrome, Homocystinuria, Sulphite oxidase deficiency. Heritable disorders reported with subluxated lenses: These include: Aniridia, Ehlers- Danlos syndrome, Craniofacial dysostosis, Alport’s syndrome, Megalocornea. Ocular diseases which may lead to subluxated lenses: It includes: Hypermature cataract, Buphthalmos, Exfoliation syndrome of lens, Intraocular tumours.

 
#Diagnosis - Aphakia - 9B11.0
Diagnosis depends upon the symptoms and signs of aphakia. Signs of aphakia: Retinoscopy: Retinoscopy shows high hypermetropia. Purkinje’s image: There are only two Purkinje’s images coming from the cornea. Images from the lens surface are missing. Scar at limbus: Surgical aphakia may show scar at the limbus. Anterior chamber: Anterior chamber is deep due to absence of lens from the eye. Pupil: The pupil appears jet black in the absence of lens. Iridodonesis: Iridodonesis or tremulousness of iris is present due to lack of support being provided by the lens. Fundus: Examination shows hypermetropic fundus and the optic disc appears small.
 
#Symptoms - Aphakia - 9B11.0
Aphakia causes symptoms such as Diminution of uncorrected vision. Inability to focus (due to loss of accommodation caused by aphakia).
 
#Overview - Aphakia - 9B11.0
Aphakia is a condition in which crystalline lens of the eye is not present in its normal position of pupillary area. Either there is no crystalline lens inside the eye or the lens is subluxated or luxated. This induces a refractive state which is not a refractive error in true sense. An emmetropic (normal refraction) eye or one having low grade ametropia (refractive error) becomes extremely hypermetropic after cataract surgery. A previously emmetropic eye requires a correction of about 10 to 11 dioptres (D) in spectacle when worn in the usual position.
#Treatment - Aphakia - 9B11.0
Medical optical therapy: Optical therapy of aphakia comprises of prescribing appropriate convex lenses. The convex lenses may be prescribed in the form of Spectacles:  Usually about + 10 D of correction with appropriate cylindrical power for surgically induced astigmatism is prescribed to correct aphakia in previously emmetropic eye. Exact power of glasses required differs in individual cases. Further addition of plus power is required for presbyopia (near vision) to compensate for loss of accommodation. Contact lenses: Correction of aphakia at the corneal plane requires use of contact lenses. As the position at which the optical correction is made moves closer to retina, the necessary diopteric power increases but the subsequent magnification decreases. Surgical therapy: Surgical therapy includes: Intraocular lens (IOL) implantation, Refractive corneal surgery.Prognosis: Prognosis for aphakia is generally good, unless there are complications like corneal oedema, cystoid macular oedema or secondary glaucoma.
