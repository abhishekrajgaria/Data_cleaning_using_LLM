#Complications - Vernal Keratoconjunctivitis - 9A60.5
Ocular complications of VKC may include: Corneal scarring. Corneal ulcer. Corneal opacity. Microbial keratitis (inflammation of cornea). Hyperplasia of limbal tissue. Steroid induced cataract and glaucoma. Visual impairment. Amlyopia may be caused by corneal opacity, irregular corneal astigmatism or keratoconus. Glaucoma or cataract may be caused by unsupervised use of topical corticosteroids.
#Diagnosis - Vernal Keratoconjunctivitis - 9A60.5
Diagnosis of VKC is based upon typical clinical features, thus many mild or atypical cases may escape diagnosis. Lack of standardised diagnostic criteria regarding the severity of VKC renders this disease more difficult to diagnose and manage. Despite facts suggesting immune responses in the pathogenesis of VKC, no clinical or laboratory test has evolved to support the diagnosis in atypical cases or predict the course of disease. History of atopy in patient or the family, elevated serum level of total and specific IgE, higher number of eosinophils and mast cells, increased level of mediators and favourable response to anti-allergic therapy is observed in VKC. Prevalence of IgE sensitisation is found to be significantly lesser in bulbar as compared to palpebral and mixed type of VKC.
#Prevention - Vernal Keratoconjunctivitis - 9A60.5
Like most type I hypersensitivity disorders, avoidance of allergen is emphasised in prevention of disease. Although permanent relocation to a cooler climate may not be feasible in many cases, it remains a very effective relief for VKC patients. Maintenance of an air-conditioned environment and control of dust particles may also be beneficial.
#Treatment - Vernal Keratoconjunctivitis - 9A60.5
Management should be carried out under medical supervision. Education of patients and their parents about the chronic, recurrent and ultimately resolving nature of disease is an important aspect of management. Compliance with medical advice is better with a well-informed patient. Medical therapy: General measures: Avoid non-specific triggering stimuli: Avoid non-specific triggering stimuli such as exposure to wind, sun and salt water which causes frequent conjunctival redness. Avoid allergens: Contact with common allergens like plants and flowers should be avoided. Sunglasses: Use of protective sunglasses is helpful and should be advised. Artificial tears: Artificial tears have been shown to be effective in relief of symptoms by direct removal and dilution of allergens from the ocular surface. Cold compresses: cold compresses provide symptomatic relief, especially from ocular pruritus. Frequent washing: Frequent face, hand and hair washing, especially before going to bed, may be helpful. Drug therapy: Most drugs used are merely palliative, and are not enough to treat and eliminate allergic ocular inflammation, so there is recurrence of disease on discontinuation of therapy. Judicious and scrupulous use of medicines is important because drug treatment is prolonged and frequent. Some patients may need medicine throughout the year for satisfactory symptomatic relief.
#Causes - Vernal Keratoconjunctivitis - 9A60.5
The exact aetiology and pathogenesis is still not clear, although allergic nature of this disease is being accepted for long. Role of genetic predisposition and environmental factors in onset, its progression and resolution of this self-limiting disease, is not clear. Genetics of disease: No genetic predisposing factor has been identified, but the predominance of VKC in Asia and Africa strengthens the possibility of a genetic predisposition. Type I (immediate) hypersensitivity reaction occur when a sensitised individual comes into contact with a specific antigen. Immunoglobulin E (IgE) has a strong affinity for mast cells, and the cross-linking of IgE with antigen triggers mast cell degranulation. Mast cell degranulation releases various mediators of inflammatory cascade which results in an increase in vascular permeability and migration of eosinophils and neutrophils. Associated conditions: Family history of allergic disorders and multiple atopic diseases may be present in some patients suffering from VKC. Conditions which may be associated with VKC are: Atopy: Atopy, defined as the presence of allergen-specific IgE antibodies, is common among VKC patients. Asthma is the most common atopic disease found among VKC patients. Other associated atopic diseases may be eczema, rhinitis or urticaria. Keratoconus (conical cornea) and acute hydrops (stromal oedema due to leakage of aqueous): Keratoconus and acute hydrops may be associated with VKC. Sex-hormone related diseases: Sex-hormone related diseases such as gynaecomastia, mammary fibro-adenoma, polycystic ovary syndrome and autoimmune diseases are also being reported with VKC.
#Overview - Vernal Keratoconjunctivitis - 9A60.5
Vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) or spring catarrh is a chronic, recurrent, bilateral, at times asymmetrical, seasonally exacerbated external ocular inflammation affecting children and young adults. VKC usually begins before the age of 10 years. It generally resolves around puberty, usually about 4-10 years after onset and only rarely may persist beyond the age of 25 years. It is more common in males than in females. The male preponderance is prominent below 20 years of age but thereafter, male and female ratio of involvement becomes almost equal. The exact aetiology and pathogenesis is still unclear, although allergic nature of this disease is being accepted for long. Role of genetic predisposition and environmental factors in onset, progression and resolution of this self-limiting disease, but incapacitating at times, is not clear. Occurrence of this disease is not limited to spring, with episodes of reactivity being quite common in winter. Initial seasonal feature turn into perennial (occurring throughout the year) disease after few years.
#Symptoms - Vernal Keratoconjunctivitis - 9A60.5
Patients with VKC may have several episodes of active inflammation throughout the year, but symptoms are characteristically worse during spring and summer. Patient may have following symptoms in eyes: Itching is the most important and most common symptom. Itching may vary from mild to intense and is exacerbated by exposure to dust, wind, bright light, hot weather or physical exertion associated with sweating. Conjunctival redness. Watering. Thick mucoid discharge with sticky mucous filaments, called ‘ropy discharge’, is characteristic of VKC. Pain and discomfort. Irritation. Foreign body sensation. Chemosis (swelling of conjunctiva). Photophobia (increased sensitivity to light). Blepharospasm (involuntary closure of eyelid muscles). In addition to ocular (eye) symptoms, patient may show symptoms of associated systemic allergic or atopic conditions such as eczema, asthma, rhinitis or urticaria.
