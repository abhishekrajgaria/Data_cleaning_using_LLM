#Causes - Orbital Dermoid - 2F36.Y
Dermoids are produced due to entrapment of embryonic epithelial nests when foetal suture lines close during embryogenesis. Fronto-zygomatic suture is the most commonly involved suture. Dermoids may also involve fronto-ethmoid or fronto-maxillary sutures.
#Complications - Orbital Dermoid - 2F36.Y
Dermoid cyst may lead to complications like: Displacement of globe, Inflammation in adjacent tissues if the cyst leaks or ruptures, Neurologic complications if the cyst compresses optic nerve or cranial nerve IIIrd IVth or VIth.
#Diagnosis - Orbital Dermoid - 2F36.Y
Diagnosis depends upon the presenting history and clinical examination. Imaging studies: Radiography, CT scan, Magnetic Resonance imaging (MRI), Ultrasonography, Colour Doppler imaging.
#Overview - Orbital Dermoid - 2F36.Y
Orbital dermoid is a congenital benign cystic teratoma (choristoma) that originates from aberrant ectodermal tissue. In these tumours, there is embryonic displacement of epidermis to a subcutaneous location along embryonic lines of closure. As two suture lines of skull close during embryonic development, epidermal or dermal elements may pinch off and form cysts. Orbital dermoids are not attached to the skin.
#Treatment - Orbital Dermoid - 2F36.Y
Management should be carried out under medical supervision. Medical management: No medical treatment is normally required for an orbital dermoid. Ruptured dermoid cyst may cause inflammation. Inflammation may be controlled with oral steroids. Surgical management: Mainstay of treatment is surgical for dermoid cyst. Superficial dermoid is excised for cosmetic reasons. Deep dermoid may require anterior, lateral or combined orbitotomy to avoid their leakage into adjacent tissues.
#Symptoms - Orbital Dermoid - 2F36.Y
Orbital dermoid may present as: Painless superotemporal mass in orbit, Painless superonasal mass in orbit, Mechanical ptosis (drooping of upper eyelid), Proptosis (protrusion of eyeball), Diplopia (double vision).
