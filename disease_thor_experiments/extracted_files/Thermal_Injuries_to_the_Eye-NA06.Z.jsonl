#Complications - Thermal Injuries to the Eye - NA06.Z
Potential complications and sequelae of thermal injuries to the eye are: Lids: Posterior displacement of meibomian orifices. Trichiasis. Cicatricial ectropion. Cicatricial entropion. Lagophthalmos (inability to close the eyelids completely). Ankyloblepharon (adhesion of eyelids to each other). Ocular surface: Dry eye. Loss of goblet cells. Damage to lacrimal system. Corneal scarring. Corneal neovascularisation. Limbal stem cell deficiency. Symblepharon. Corneal melt. Corneal opacity. Intraocular inflammation. Recurrent corneal erosions. Non healing epithelial defects. Microbial keratitis.
#Overview - Thermal Injuries to the Eye - NA06.Z
Thermal injuries to the eye are potentially blinding eye injuries and constitute true emergencies. Thermal injuries to the eye are less common than chemical injuries, with very different forms of ocular insult, post-injury problems, and treatment approaches. Thermal injuries are of importance due to increased occurrence during festival and festivities.
#Symptoms - Thermal Injuries to the Eye - NA06.Z
Symptoms may include: Severe pain. Red eyes. Watering or epiphora. Foreign body sensation. Blurring of vision. Reduced visual acuity. Photophobia (increased sensitivity to light). Blepharospasm. In massive thermal burns, patient may require systemic resuscitation.
#Causes - Thermal Injuries to the Eye - NA06.Z
Thermal injuries result from accidents associated with firework explosion, steam, boiling water, or molten metal. Thermal burns include those caused by a flame, which are usually severe with deep tissue injury, and those caused by flash accidents, such as explosions or electrical arcs, which are usually more superficial but may be extensive. The thermal injury is immediate and non-progressive. The majority of ocular thermal injuries can be divided into: Flame burns: Flame burns are secondary to fire. They tend to be deep dermal or full thickness. Scalds: Scalds may be caused by spilling hot drinks or liquids or being exposed to hot bathing water. Scalds tend to cause superficial to superficial dermal burns. Contact burns: Contact burns are the result of direct exposure to a hot object. Contact burns tend to be deep dermal or full thickness.
#Diagnosis - Thermal Injuries to the Eye - NA06.Z
Patients with ocular thermal trauma should undergo early evaluation of the eye to assess the extent of the injury and exclude the possibility of an intraocular or intraorbital foreign body. The frequency of eye examination must balance the risk of ocular sequelae with the risk of contamination. Diagnosis requires: Examination of eyelids and adjacent tissues: The depth and extent of burns in the eyelids and adjacent areas should be assessed initially. The presence or absence of eyebrow hair and eyelashes should be well documented. Presence of these indicates sparing of the eyelid margin. Loss of these is associated with a deep partial-thickness or full-thickness burn. Bell’s phenomenon: Bell’s phenomenon is a protective reflex in which eyeball is seen turned upwards and slightly outwards during eyelid closure to avoid corneal exposure. Foreign bodies, if any.
#Prevention - Thermal Injuries to the Eye - NA06.Z
Education and training regarding prevention of exposures in the workplace can help in preventing thermal injuries to the eye. For general prevention, safety glasses may be used to safeguard eyes. Even these measures may not suffice in high-velocity (explosive) injury.
#Treatment - Thermal Injuries to the Eye - NA06.Z
Medical therapy: Emergency management: Irrigation of eyes: Emergency management requires prompt irrigation and the removal of residual debris from the eye. Irrigation cools the ocular surface and removes any inflammatory substance. Any available neutral irrigation solution may be used in emergency. Solutions available for irrigation include normal saline, normal saline with bicarbonate, RingerÕs lactate, balanced salt solution (BSS), and BSS- plus. No therapeutic differences have been noted among these solutions. After copious irrigation, necrotic corneal epithelium should be dŽbrided to promote re-epithelialisation. Where possible, topical anaesthetic drops should be instilled to reduce pain and blepharospasm, thereby facilitating irrigation. Acute and reparative phases: After irrigation, better outcomes may be expected with prompt re-epithelialisation, while delayed or absent re-epithelialisation may require surgical intervention. Topical artificial tears: Topical artificial tears may be used as lubricant to the ocular surface to counter the effects of lagophthalmos. Topical antibiotics: Topical antibiotics may be used for any epithelial defects to prevent any secondary infection. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the most common gram-negative organism which may infect the affected cornea. Surgical therapy: Surgical intervention that may help stabilising the ocular surface in severe thermal injury includes: Tenonplasty: Tenonplasty attempts to re-establish limbal vascularity in severe injuries and to promote re- epithelialisation. In this, all necrotic conjunctival and episcleral tissues are excised. TenonÕs capsule is dissected with blunt instrument, and the resultant flap with its preserved blood supply is advanced to the limbus. Tissue adhesives (tissue glue): Tissue adhesives preserve integrity in the event of corneal thinning with impending or actual perforation of the globe. This is usually accompanied by the application of a soft bandage contact lens, which prevents glue dislodgement. Tissue glue can stop further melting by excluding inflammatory cells and their mediators. Tissue adhesives also provide a means of delaying penetrating keratoplasty. Amniotic membrane transplantation: Amniotic membrane transplantation may be used as supplement to surgical procedures where coverage of raw surfaces or suppression of inflammation is required. Amniotic membrane has anti-angiogenic (inhibitors of blood vessels growth) and anti-inflammatory proteins capable of suppressing the inflammatory response. Amniotic membrane can create a new basement membrane and promote epithelial healing. Amniotic membrane might be applied after a thermal injury following emergency services, usually weeks later. Despite benefits, amniotic membrane cannot replace the need for corneal stem cells. Corneal stem cell transplantation: Replacement of the corneal stem cells lost due to injury is important in restoration of an intact and normal corneal epithelial cell layer. These primitive, slow-cycling stem cells are located in the limbal area.
