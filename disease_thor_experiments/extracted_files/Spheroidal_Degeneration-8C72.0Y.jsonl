#Diagnosis - Spheroidal Degeneration - 8C72.0Y
Since spheroidal degeneration is associated with UV light exposure, patients may have other systemic findings of exposure to the elements such as history of skin cancer, pigmentary changes, or other actinic disorders. Examination should be carried out under slit lamp (bio-microscopy) by an eye specialist.
#Causes - Spheroidal Degeneration - 8C72.0Y
The exact cause of spheroidal degeneration is not known. It is hypothesized to be due to: Drying of the cornea, Repeated corneal trauma, Low humidity, Spontaneous in the conjunctiva and cornea of the aged. Although spheroidal degeneration is classically associated with ageing and ultraviolet exposure, it has also been described in childhood with much less frequency.
#Prevention - Spheroidal Degeneration - 8C72.0Y
Spheroidal degeneration may be prevented by: Ultraviolet light (UV) blocking sunglasses: UV light blocking sunglasses in areas of sand and dust. Side protectors of the sunglasses may be placed to prevent exposure to environmental irritants. Avoiding solar irradiation: Avoiding solar irradiation and repeated micro-trauma of the cornea may also prevent the formation of spheroidal degeneration.
#Overview - Spheroidal Degeneration - 8C72.0Y
Spheroidal degeneration (climatic droplet keratopathy, Biettiâ€™s band-shaped nodular dystrophy, chronic actinic keratopathy or Labrador keratopathy) is a nonhereditary acquired degenerative condition of the eye. Spheroidal degeneration is characterised by sub-epithelial accumulation of spherical opalescent droplets that coalesce to form bands or nodules with elevated corneal epithelium. The degenerative process is mainly seen in the inter-palpebral part of the cornea.
#Treatment - Spheroidal Degeneration - 8C72.0Y
Management should be carried out under medical supervision. The majority of patients of spheroidal degeneration are asymptomatic. General medical therapy: Ultraviolet light protection, Topical artificial tears. Surgical therapy: Excimer laser assisted phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK), Lamellar or penetrating keratoplasty.
#Symptoms - Spheroidal Degeneration - 8C72.0Y
Spheroidal degeneration is asymptomatic in majority of the cases. Visual acuity may be affected if the deposits extend towards the center of the cornea, thereby, blocking the visual axis. Ocular (eye) symptoms in advanced cases may be: Irritation, Discomfort, Foreign body sensation, Diminution of vision.
