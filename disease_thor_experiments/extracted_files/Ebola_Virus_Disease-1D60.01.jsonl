#Causes - Ebola Virus Disease - 1D60.01
EVD is caused by four of five viruses in the genus Ebola virus, family Filoviridae, order Mononegavirales. The four disease-causing viruses in humans are as follows: Bundibugyo Ebola virus (BDBV), Zaire Ebola virus/Ebola virus (EBOV), Sudan Ebola virus (SUDV), Taï Forest Ebola virus (TAFV). The fifth virus called Reston Ebola virus (RESTV) is known to cause disease in non human primates (monkeys, gorillas, and chimpanzees). Transmission: Primary Source of Infection: The virus is transmitted from animals to humans. Secondary Source of Infection: The virus can be transmitted from human-to- human.
#Diagnosis - Ebola Virus Disease - 1D60.01
It is difficult to diagnose the disease in early stages of infection as the early symptoms are non specific to Ebola virus infection. However, it can be diagnosed through several lab tests such as: Antibody-capture enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Antigen detection tests. Polymerase Chain Reaction(PCR). Virus isolation by cell culture. Electron microscopy.
#Overview - Ebola Virus Disease - 1D60.01
Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) also known as Ebola haemorrhagic fever(EHF) is one of the viral haemorrhagic fevers which affects a person's blood system. It is a severe, often fatal illness in humans and non human primates (monkeys, gorillas, and chimpanzees). It is caused by infection with virus which  is transmitted to people from wild animals and spreads in the human population. Severely infected patients require intensive supportive care. No specific treatment or vaccine is available for this disease.
#Prevention - Ebola Virus Disease - 1D60.01
The primary preventive measures comprises of isolation   and barrier nursing techniques. Quarantine, a state of enforced isolation, is effective in decreasing the spread of disease and illnessespecially in the case of communicable diseases. Barrier nursing techniques include: Wearing  protective clothing (such as masks, gloves, gowns, and goggles). Use of infection-control measures (such as complete equipment sterilization and routine use of disinfectant). Fumigation of   environment and disinfection of   surroundings. Dead bodies can transmit Ebola, don't touch them without a protective gear or better avoid them altogether. Wash your hands with soap or use sanitizer.
#Treatment - Ebola Virus Disease - 1D60.01
No vaccine for Ebola Virus Disease is available. There is no specific treatment for this disease. However, the standard treatment for Ebola virus Disease includes an intensive supportive therapy. This consists of: balancing the patient’s fluids and electrolytes, maintaining their oxygen status and blood pressure, treating them for any other infections. It is very important to provide the treatment/supportive care of Ebola haemorrhagic fever (EHF) timely, since it is difficult to diagnose the disease in the early stages of infection.
#Symptoms - Ebola Virus Disease - 1D60.01
Symptoms of Ebola Virus Disease: Fever, Headache, Weakness, Joint and muscle pain, Diarrhoea, Vomiting, Pain in stomach, Loss of appetite. This disease further progresses to bleeding phase which causes external bleeding from eyes, nose ears as well as bleeding inside the body.
