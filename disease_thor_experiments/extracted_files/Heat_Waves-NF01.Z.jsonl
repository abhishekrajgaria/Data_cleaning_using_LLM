#Diagnosis - Heat Waves - NF01.Z
In most cases diagnosis is made clinically. This involves taking the temperature and assessing the symptoms of heat exhaustion and heat stroke. Baseline tests should include: Blood test, Muscle function test, Cerebrospinal fluid analysis, Imaging Studies, Other Tests: Electrocardiography.
#Overview - Heat Waves - NF01.Z
Heat- Related Illnesses are the various manifestations of extreme heat and are increasing with increased global warming and heat waves. Climate change is leading to an increase in average temperatures and increased possibilities of severe heat waves. Extreme heat can lead to minor illnesses, such as heat rash (prickly heat), heat oedema, heat cramps, and tetany, as well as serious illnesses as heat syncope, heat exhaustion and heat stroke. Heat stroke is the most severe form of the heat-related illness.
#Prevention - Heat Waves - NF01.Z
To minimise the impact during the heat wave and to prevent serious heat related illnesses at community and individual level following DO’s and DONT’s are suggested: DO’s: Eat light, cool, easy-to-digest foods such as fresh fruits or salads (thoroughly clean with safe water). While travelling, carry water with you. Keep animals in shade and give them plenty of water to drink. Take a cool bath. Pregnant workers and workers with a medical condition should be given additional attention. DONT’s: Don’t leave children and pets alone in parked cars for any amount of time.  Avoid wearing dark, heavy or tight fitting clothes. Avoid heavy, hard-to-digest foods and do not eat stale food. Avoid cooking during peak hours.
#Riskfactor - Heat Waves - NF01.Z
Risk factors for heatstroke include male sex, sleep deprivation, obesity, poor physical conditioning, lack of acclimatization, diuretic therapy, dehydration, febrile illness, alcohol abuse, skin diseases that affect sweating, heavy protective gear, drugs impairing normal thermoregulatory response, and a past history of HS.
#Treatment - Heat Waves - NF01.Z
Heat rash: Minimize sweating by staying in an air-conditioned environment, taking frequent showers and wearing light clothes, Keep the affected area dry. Heat cramps: Treatment of heat cramps include rest, cooling the body, oral hydration, and stretching the muscles that are cramping. Heat oedema: Treatment is not required as oedema usually subsides following acclimatization. Heat syncope: The patient should rest in a cool place and be placed in a supine position with legs and hips elevated to increase venous return. Heat exhaustion: Move the patient to a cool, shaded room or air-conditioned place, Lay the patient down and raise his or her legs and hips to increase venous return. Heat stroke: Measure core temperature (rectal probe): if > 40°C, move to a cooler place, administer oxygen 4 l/min and isotonic crystalloid (normal saline) solution.
#Causes - Heat Waves - NF01.Z
Heat-related illnesses produce a high body temperature because the body cannot transfer heat effectively or because external heat gain is excessive. Heat rash (Prickly heat) develops when the sweat ducts become blocked and swell. Heat oedema develops when heat causes the blood vessels to expand (dilate) and body fluid moves into the hands or legs by gravity. Heat syncope occurs when heat causes the blood vessels to expand (dilate) in order to keep body cool; as a result blood flow to the brain is reduced causing fainting. Heat exhaustion occurs when body loses body fluids and salts (sweating), when exposed to high temperatures for long periods of time. Heat stroke results when the body fails to regulate its own temperature, and body temperature continues to rise.
#Symptoms - Heat Waves - NF01.Z
symptoms of various heat related illnesses are: Heat rash (Prickly heat) - Small, red, itchy papules appear on the face, neck, upper chest, under breast, groin and scrotum areas. Heat cramps-Muscle cramping might be the early sign of heat-related illness, and may lead to heat exhaustion or stroke. Heat oedema is swelling of legs and hands. Heat tetany- Symptoms may include hyperventilation, respiratory problems, numbness or tingling, or muscle spasms. Heat syncope (fainting) – Symptoms of heat syncope include light-headedness, dizziness, fainting. Heat Exhaustion: symptoms are fatigue, weakness, dizziness, headache, nausea, vomiting, muscle cramps and sweating; skin is pale, cool, and moist. Heat stroke results in high body temperature 40 °C (104 °F) or more, hot, red, dry skin, rapid and week pulse (tachycardia), tachypnoea (rapid breathing), nausea, hypotension, unconsciousness (delirium, seizures, stupor, confusion or coma).
