#Diagnosis - Euryblepharon - LA14.0Y
Diagnosis of euryblepharon is based on clinical features. Euryblepharon presents with: Bilateral symmetrical enlargement of the horizontal palpebral apertures. Vertical shortening of eyelid skin. Downward and lateral displacement of outer canthi. Differential diagnosis: Euryblepharon may be distinguished from conditions such as: Congenital ectropion, Lower lid ptosis, Other causes of epiphora.
#Causes - Euryblepharon - LA14.0Y
Euryblepharon may be inherited as an autosomal dominant disorder or may occur sporadically. A variety of systemic conditions may be associated such as: Kabuki syndrome: Kabuki syndrome, described in 1981, is an idiopathic multisystem disorder characterised by characteristic facial features, short stature, mental retardation, and skeletal abnormalities. Blepharo-cheilo-dontic (BCD) syndrome: This congenital condition is characterised by euryblepharon with ectropion of the lower eyelids, cleft lip/palate, and dental anomalies (oligodontia and conical teeth). Down syndrome.
#Symptoms - Euryblepharon - LA14.0Y
Euryblepharon may be unilateral or bilateral. It may present with: Enlargement of horizontal palpebral apertures. Elongated lid margins. Downward and lateral displacement of outer canthus. Lateral ectropion. Lagophthalmos. Watering or epiphora. Reduced blink rate. Exposure keratopathy.
#Treatment - Euryblepharon - LA14.0Y
Medical therapy: Topical lubricant artificial tears: Topical lubricant artificial tears may be used to prevent ocular irritation. Surgical therapy: It may involve procedures like: Lateral tarsorrhaphy. Lateral canthoplasty with shortening of the upper and lower eyelids laterally. Re-suspension of lateral canthus. Augmentation of posterior lamella and anterior skin graft, for severe forms of vertical eyelid shortening. Prognosis: Prognosis of euryblepharon may be excellent if necessary surgery for eyelid mal-position is performed to protect ocular surface.
 
#Overview - Euryblepharon - LA14.0Y
Euryblepharon is characterised by increased vertical separation of the temporal aspect of the palpebral fissure so that the palpebral conjunctiva is not in apposition with the eye. The enlargement of palpebral fissure is accompanied by variable degree of lower eyelid ectropion. The lower eyelid ectropion is caused by vertical shortening of the lower eyelid relative to the horizontal dimensions of the opposing upper eyelid. Euryblepharon is present at birth and there is no other associated primary ocular abnormality. In contrast, secondary enlargement of the palpebral aperture may accompany a variety of ocular abnormalities.
