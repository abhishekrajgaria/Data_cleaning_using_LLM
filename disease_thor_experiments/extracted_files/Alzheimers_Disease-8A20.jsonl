#Diagnosis - Alzheimer Disease - 8A20
Early, accurate diagnosis is crucial for several reasons. It can tell people whether their symptoms are due to Alzheimer’s disease or another cause, such as stroke, tumour, Parkinson’s disease, sleep disturbances, side effects of medications, or other conditions that may be treatable and possibly reversible. Although definitive diagnosis of Alzheimer's can be made only after death, yet the doctors can usually diagnose the disease with the help of: Past medical history and current health status. Changes in the behavior and personality of the patient. Conducting cognitive tests involving memory, problem solving, language, etc. Standard medical tests, such as blood and urine tests, in order to rule out other causes. Brain scans including CT/MRI scans.
#Causes - Alzheimer Disease - 8A20
Scientists have not yet understood the exact cause of Alzheimer's disease. It is postulated to have multifactorial etiology like: Genetic: The Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene is implicated in Alzheimer’s Disease. This gene has several forms. One of them, ApoE ε4, seems to increase a person’s risk of getting the disease. However, carrying the ApoE ε4 form of the gene does not necessarily mean that a person will develop Alzheimer’s disease, and people carrying no ApoE ε4 can also develop the disease. Environmental/ Lifestyle factors: Diseases like heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity, hyperlipidemia etc. have also shown to be linked with the Alzheimer's disease.
#Prevention - Alzheimer Disease - 8A20
There is no definitive evidence to support that any particular measure   is effective in preventing. However, there are certain steps that could be taken which may help to delay the onset of dementia. Staying mentally healthy by: Reading, Writing for pleasure, Playing musical instruments, Taking part in adult education courses, Playing games, Swimming, Group sports such as bowling, Walking, And other recreational activities.
#Overview - Alzheimer Disease - 8A20
Dementia is a disorder characterized by serious loss of cognitive ability in a previously unimpaired person, beyond what might be expected from normal ageing. Alzheimer's Disease is the most common form of dementia. It is more common in older individuals. Alzheimer’s disease is an irreversible, progressive brain disease that slowly destroys memory and thinking skills, and eventually, the ability to carry out the simplest tasks of daily living. Although scientists are learning more every day, right now, they still do not know what causes Alzheimer’s disease. Thus it is an Idiopathic disease.
#Treatment - Alzheimer Disease - 8A20
There is no cure for Alzheimer's disease; though symptomatic relief can be provided. Current treatments can be divided into Medical, Psychosocial and Care giving. Various medications to treat Alzheimer's are: Donepezil, Rivastigmine, Galantamine. Psychosocial interventions are used as an adjunct to medicinal treatment and can be classified as supportive, cognitive and behavioural approaches. Care giving: Since patient with Alzheimer's has no cure, it gradually renders people incapable of tending for their own needs, thus care giving essentially is the treatment and must be managed carefully over the course of the disease.
#Symptoms - Alzheimer Disease - 8A20
Common symptoms of Alzheimers Disease are: Forgetfulness, Language difficulties including difficulty in remembering names, Difficulty in planning and problem solving, Difficulty in doing previously familiar tasks, Difficulty in concentration, Difficulty in spatial relationships like remembering roads and routes to a particular, destination, Difficulty in social behavior.
