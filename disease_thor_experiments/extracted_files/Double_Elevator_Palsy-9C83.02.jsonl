#Diagnosis - Double Elevator Palsy - 9C83.02
Diagnosis depends upon history and clinical examination. History. In congenital MED, history of onset of symptoms and its association with other features is important. The presence of associated amblyopia points to congenital aetiology. In acquired MED, history of associated neurological features (ataxia, vertigo, tinnitus, loss of consciousness) is important. History of malignancy or cardiovascular disorder is also important. Clinical examination. Clinical examination distinguishes between MED due to primary superior rectus palsy, any cause of supranuclear superior rectus weakness, or primary/secondary inferior rectus restriction. Primary superior rectus palsy or paresis: It is characterised by a forced duction test showing no restriction to full upward rotation. Bell’s phenomenon is not present. Supranuclear superior rectus weakness: This is usually congenital and is characterised by monocular absence of vertical eye movements in superior field of gaze. There is no resistance to upward gaze in forced duction test. Bell’s phenomenon is present. Patients with primary inferior rectus restriction or fibrosis: This group of patients often do not have hypotropia in primary gaze. Forced duction test shows restriction to upward rotation because of inferior rectus restriction. Superior rectus palsy or supranuclear disorders may produce secondary contracture in inferior rectus. Hypotropia and ptosis are usually present. Forced duction test shows inferior rectus restriction. Investigations Besides regular blood tests, following tests may be done. Chest radiography. Computed tomography. Cerebral angiography. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain stem.
#Causes - Double Elevator Palsy - 9C83.02
Causes may include congenital and acquired cases. Congenital cases are characterised by orthotropia or hypotropia in primary position of gaze, true ptosis or pseudoptosis in majority of cases. A large number of cases on forced duction test, show restriction of eyeball in elevation. Jaw movement as in yawning may show paradoxical movements of eyelids (Marcus Gunn phenomenon). Dissociated vertical deviation (DVD) may be present. Upward and outward rolling of eyeballs or Bell’s phenomenon is often preserved. Since elevation is preserved in Bell’s phenomenon, DVD or under anaesthesia, several authors believe it to be a supranuclear disorder. Others discuss it to be a fascicular lesion. Long lasting palsy of superior rectus alone may impede elevation in adduction, thus nuclear origin of superior rectus may be a factor. Even primary fibrotic origin is presumed in cases showing resistance to forced duction test. Thus supranuclear, nuclear, fascicular and muscular causes are discussed for double elevator palsy. Cerebrovascular diseases such as hypertension, thromboembolism, and arteritis usually cause acquired cases. Other causes of double elevator palsy include Infectious disease, Tumours, Sarcoidosis.
#Symptoms - Double Elevator Palsy - 9C83.02
Symptoms of MED includes Vertical misalignment of eyes. Profound restriction of elevation across horizontal plane, from adduction to abduction with orthophoria in primary position. Abnormal head posture with chin elevation. Ptosis. Amblyopia. Diplopia.
#Overview - Double Elevator Palsy - 9C83.02
Double Elevator Palsy refers to limited elevation of one eye in adduction, primary gaze, and abduction. The term double elevator refers to both the elevators of an eye i.e. superior rectus and inferior oblique muscle. However, there are cases in which deficient elevation is produced by tight inferior rectus muscle. Due to this, Double elevator palsy is included under restrictive strabismus. Now Double elevator palsy is known by a more descriptive term as Monocular Elevation Deficit Syndrome (MED).This is distinguished from Brown’s syndrome in which elevation is restricted much more in adduction rather than in abduction.
#Treatment - Double Elevator Palsy - 9C83.02
Management is not required in all cases of MED. Patients with orthophoria in primary position of gaze or with limited changes in head position may be just observed. Medical therapy. Refractive error correction: Any associated refractive error is corrected. Amblyopia treatment: If amblyopia is noticed in congenital MED, it needs to be treated. Surgical therapy Indications for surgery are Deviation of eyes producing amblyopia and suppression. Vertical deviation in primary position of gaze. Diplopia in primary position of gaze. Contracted binocular fields Ptosis surgery if significant ptosis persist after strabismus surgery.
