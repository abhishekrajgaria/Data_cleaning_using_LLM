#Diagnosis - Disabilities - 6A00.Z
Diagnosis of particular disability may be done at health care centre with the help of a specialist. A concerned medical authority in Government hospital can issue a disability certificate*. The disability certificate and/ or Identity card is the basic document that a person with any disability of more than 40 percent requires in order to avail any facilities, benefits or concessions under the available schemes.
#Overview - Disabilities - 6A00.Z
Disability is a global public health problem as people with disability, throughout the life course, face widespread barriers in accessing health and related services, such as rehabilitation, and has worse health outcomes than people without disability. Disability is any continuing condition that restricts everyday activities. The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) defines disability as an umbrella term for impairments, activity limitations and participation restrictions. Impairment is a problem in body function or structure; an activity limitation is a difficulty encountered by an individual in executing a task or action; participation restriction is a problem experienced by an individual in involvement in life situations.
#Prevention - Disabilities - 6A00.Z
Disability prevention includes all actions taken to reduce the occurrence of impairment (first level prevention) and its development into functional limitation (second level prevention), and to prevent the transition of functional limitation to disability (third level prevention). Primary prevention is the actions to avoid or remove the cause of a health problem in an individual or a population before it arises. It includes health promotion measures designed to promote general health and well being and quality of life of the people; and specific protection by specific protective measures such as polio vaccination, intake of iodized salt. The concept is also now being applied to the prevention of chronic diseases (coronary heart disease, hypertension and cancer), based on elimination or modification of risk factors of the disease such as prevention of harmful lifestyle including eating pattern, lack of physical exercise, smoking.
#Symptoms - Disabilities - 6A00.Z
General symptoms for a disabled person according to type of disability- i. Disability in seeing/ visual disability: A visually disabled person does not have any light perception (both eyes taken together) or has light perception but cannot count fingers of a hand (with spectacles/contact lenses if he/she uses spectacles/contact lenses) from a distance of 3 meters (or 10 feet) in good day light with both eyes open. The visually disabled persons may be categorized into two broad groups: Blindness: A person who does not have light perception and a person who has light perception but cannot count fingers at a distance of 1 meter even with spectacles are taken as blind. Low vision: A person who has light perception but cannot count fingers up to a distance of 3 meters even with spectacles is taken as a person with Low Vision. ii. Disability in speech/speech disability: A person is unable to speak like normal persons. iii. Disability in hearing/hearing disability: A person may have problem in hearing day to day conversational speech when hearing aid is not used. Mental disability A mentally disabled person has difficulty in understanding routine instructions or does not carry out his/ her activities like others of similar age or exhibited behaviours like talking to self, laughing/crying, staring, violence, fear and suspicion without reason.
#Treatment - Disabilities - 6A00.Z
Increasing evidence suggests that, as a group, people with disabilities experience poorer levels of health than the general population. By improving access to quality, affordable health care services, health outcomes for people with disabilities can be improved. Primary health-care services with the support of specialists can provide health services to people with disability. Health services should be focused for the following health conditions: Primary health conditions: A primary health condition is the possible starting point for impairment can lead to a wide range of impairments, including mobility, sensory, mental, and communication impairments. Secondary conditions: Secondary conditions occur in addition to (and are related to) a primary health condition, and are both predictable and therefore preventable; such as depression is a common secondary condition in people with disabilities, osteoporosis is common in people with a spinal cord injury or cerebral palsy.
#Risk Factor - Disabilities - 6A00.Z
Communicable diseases (Infectious diseases) such as lymphatic filariasis, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, and other sexually transmitted diseases; neurological consequences of some diseases such as encephalitis, meningitis, and childhood cluster diseases (such as measles, mumps, and poliomyelitis) contribute to disability. Non communicable diseases (NCDs)- Chronic diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, arthritis and cancer cause the majority of long-term disabilities. The increase in NCDs observed in all parts of the world, will have a profound effect on disability. Lifestyle choices and personal behavior such as obesity, physical inactivity, tobacco use, alcohol consumption, illicit drugs that lead to non communicable diseases are also becoming major contributing factors; Air pollution, occupational disease, poor water supply, sanitation, and personal and domestic hygiene, malnutrition also contribute for disability. Injuries due to road traffic accidents, occupational injury, violence, conflicts, falls and landmines have long been recognized as contributors to disability.
