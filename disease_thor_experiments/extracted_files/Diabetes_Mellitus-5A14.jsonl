#Causes - Diabetes Mellitus - 5A14
Type 1 Diabetes: The immune system of body attacks and destroys the cells that produce insulin. As no insulin is produced, glucose levels further increase, which can seriously damage the body's organs. Type 1 diabetes is often known as insulin-dependent diabetes. Type 2 Diabetes: Type 2 diabetes is where the body does not produce enough insulin or the body's cells do not respond to insulin. This is known as insulin resistance. Type 2 diabetes, and is far more common than type 1 diabetes. Gestational Diabetes: Some women tend to experience high levels of blood glucose as during pregnancy due  to reduced sensitivity of insulin receptors.
#Diagnosis - Diabetes Mellitus - 5A14
The clinical diagnosis of diabetics is often prompted by symptoms such as increased thirst and urination and recurrent infections. Blood Tests - Fasting plasma glucose, two-hour postprandial test and oral glucose tolerance test are done to know blood glucose levels. Glycated Haemoglobin (HbA1c) may be used to diagnose diabetes(if facilities are easily available). Other tests: Fasting lipid profile, including total, LDL, and HDL cholesterol and triglycerides, Liver function tests, Kidney function tests, Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) in type 1 diabetes, dyslipidemia, or women over 50 years of age.
#Overview - Diabetes Mellitus - 5A14
Diabetes mellitus is a group of metabolic diseases in which the person has high blood glucose (blood sugar) level either due to inadequate insulin production or because the body's cells do not respond properly to insulin or both. The term "Diabetes Mellitus" describes a metabolic disorder of multiple etiology characterized by chronic hyperglycemia with disturbances of carbohydrate, fat (dyslipidaemia) and protein metabolism resulting from defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. The main symptoms are: Polyuria (frequent urination), Polydipsia (increased thirst), Polyphagia (increased hunger. The main types of diabetes are: Type 1 diabetes, Type 2 diabetes, Gestational diabetes.

#Symptoms - Diabetes Mellitus - 5A14
The main symptoms of diabetes are: Polyuria: urinating frequently (particularly at night), Polydipsia: feeling very thirsty, Polyphagia: feeling hungry frequently, Weakness, Weight loss and loss of muscle bulk, Frequent episodes of thrush, Cuts or wounds that heal slowly, Blurred vision.
#Treatment - Diabetes Mellitus - 5A14
Currently, six classes of oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs) are available: biguanides (e.g., metformin), sulfonylureas (e.g., glimepiride), meglitinides (e.g., repaglinide), thiazolidinediones (e.g., pioglitazone), dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitors (e.g., sitagliptin), and Î±-glucosidase inhibitors (e.g., acarbose). Medications: Insulin, Treatment of coexisting medical conditions. Lifestyle measures: Regular exercise, Proper diet, No smoking, No alcohol. These goals help in keeping both short-term and long-term blood glucose levels within acceptable limits.
#Complication - Diabetes Mellitus - 5A14
The complications of diabetes mellitus are less common and less severe in people who have well-controlled blood sugar levels. Its complications are: Acute: Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), Hyperglycemia, Hypoglycemia, Diabetic Coma. Chronic: 1. Eye Diseases: Retinopathy (nonproliferative/proliferative), Macular oedema. 2. Neuropathy: Autonomic neuropathy affects the digestive system, blood vessels, urinary system as well as sex organs. 3. Nephropathy: Damage to kidney can lead to chronic renal failure. (b) Macro vascular diseases: Coronary artery  disease, Peripheral arterial disease, Cerebrovascular disease. (c) Other diseases: High blood sugar level in blood can lead to cataract, glaucoma.  Infectious diseases are more frequent and/or serious in patients with diabetes mellitus. Diabetic dyslipidemia.
