#Causes - Rare Diseases - 8A44.3
There are various causes of rare diseases, but still, the exact causes of many rare diseases are unknown. The common cause can be genetic, directly related with changes in genes or chromosomes. In some cases, genetic changes that cause disease are passed from one generation to the next. In other cases, genetic changes occur randomly in a person who is the first in a family with a rare disease.
#Prevention - Rare Diseases - 8A44.3
The prevention of genetic disorders can be done at multiple levels. Primary Prevention aims at preventing the occurrence of the disease, i.e., preventing the birth of an affected child. Though not always feasible, this strategy yields the highest returns in terms of decreasing the incidence & prevalence of rare disorders in the population in the long run. Secondary prevention: This strategy focuses on avoiding the birth of the affected fetus (prenatal screening and prenatal diagnosis), early detection of the disorders, appropriate medical intervention to ameliorate or minimize the manifestations (newborn screening). Tertiary prevention refers to the provision of better care and medical rehabilitation to those rare disease patients who present at an advanced stage of the disease.
#Treatment - Rare Diseases - 8A44.3
About 95% of rare diseases have no approved treatment even when a correct diagnosis is made. Where drugs are available, they are quite expensive as very few pharmaceutical companies globally manufacture drugs for rare diseases. For this reason, rare diseases are also called ‘orphan diseases’ and drugs to treat them are called “orphan drugs.
#Diagnosis - Rare Diseases - 8A44.3
Early diagnosis of rare diseases is a challenge because of multiple factors that include lack of awareness among primary care physicians, lack of adequate screening and diagnostic facilities. Delay in diagnosis or a wrong diagnosis increases the suffering of the patients. There is an immediate need to create awareness amongst the general public, patients & their families and training of doctors for early and accurate diagnosis, standardization of diagnostic modalities and development of newer diagnostic and therapeutic tools.
#Overview - Rare Diseases - 8A44.3
Rare diseases are often serious, chronic and life-threatening conditions. WHO defines a rare disease as often debilitating lifelong disease or disorder with a prevalence of 1 or less, per 1000 population. However, different countries have their definitions to suit their specific requirements and in the context of their population, the health care system and resources.
