#Treatment - Acquired Immuno Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) - 1C62.3
Definitive cure for AIDS is yet to be discovered. However, some medicines, given at certain stage of the disease, depending upon CD4 count in the blood of the patient, can prolong life of HIV positive persons. Reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors - It interferes with a critical step during the HIV life cycle and keep the virus from making copies of itself. Protease inhibitors - It interferes with a protein that HIV uses to make infectious viral particles. Fusion inhibitors - It blocks the virus from entering the body cells. Integrase inhibitors - It blocks an enzyme HIV needs, to make copies of itself. Multidrug combinations - It combines two or more different types of drugs into one. These medicines help people with HIV, but they are not perfect. They do not cure HIV/AIDS. People with HIV infection still have the virus in their bodies. They can still spread HIV to others through unprotected sex and needle sharing, even when they are taking their medicines. *NHP provides indicative information for better understanding of health. For any treatment and diagnosis purpose you should consult your physician.
#Symptoms - Acquired Immuno Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) - 1C62.3
There are 3 main stages of AIDS: Acute symptoms, clinical latency and severe symptoms. Acute symptoms: The majority of people infected by HIV develop Influenza (flu) like illness within a month or two, after the virus enters the body. This illness, known as primary or acute HIV infection, may last for a few weeks. Possible symptoms include: Headache, Fever, Sore throat, Muscle soreness, Rash, Mouth or genital ulcers, Swollen lymph glands, mainly on the neck, Joint pain, Diarrhoea, Night sweats. Clinical latency: There is persistent swelling of lymph nodes during clinical latent HIV. Else, there are no specific signs and symptoms. However, body remains infected with the virus. Severe symptoms: Headaches, Blurred and distorted vision, Cough and shortness of breath, Persistent white spots or unusual lesions on tongue or in mouth, Soaking night sweats, Shaking chills or fever higher than 100 F (38 C) for several weeks, Chronic diarrhoea, Persistent, unexplained fatigue, Weight loss, Skin rashes. 
#Prevention - Acquired Immuno Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) - 1C62.3
HIV prevention refers to practices done to prevent spread of HIV/AIDS. HIV prevention practices may be done by individuals to protect their own health: Spreading awareness among masses. Protected sexual contact through the use of condoms, reduces the risk of HIV/AIDS. Providing awareness among population about their HIV status especially in high risks population. High risks population involves sex workers and their partners, Intravenous drug users, truck drivers, labuor migrants, refugees and prisoners. Safe injections: Use of auto disposal syringes help to prevent HIV infections. Male circumcision: It is the surgical removal of the foreskin (prepuce) from the human penis. Safe blood transfusion procured only from authorized and accredited blood banks. Counselling of HIV positive pregnant mother on the issue of how to prevent parent to child transmission (PPTCT).
#Overview - Acquired Immuno Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) - 1C62.3
AIDS is caused by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). HIV kills or damages the body's immune system cells. There are two types of HIV. Type I and Type II. Type I is more common in India. AIDS is generally caused by unprotected sex with an infected partner. It may also spread through the use of infected syringes of HIV infected people and blood transfusions. The first sign of AIDS is influenza (flu) like symptoms or may be swollen glands, but at times, symptoms might not appear. Symptoms may appear after two or three months. Generally, blood test is done to confirm the diagnosis. There is no cure, but there are many medicines to fight/ control HIV infection.

#Causes - Acquired Immuno Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) - 1C62.3
A person becomes infected with HIV/AIDS by several ways: Blood transfusions: In some cases, the virus may be transmitted through blood transfusions. Sharing infected needles: HIV can be transmitted through needles and syringes contaminated with infected blood. Sexual Contact: The most frequent mode of transmission of HIV is through sexual contact with an infected person. From mother to child: A pregnant woman infected with HIV virus can transmit the virus to her foetus through their shared blood circulation, or an infected nursing mother can transmit it to her baby through her breast milk.
#Diagnosis - Acquired Immuno Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) - 1C62.3
HIV test is done to detect human immunodeficiency virus in saliva, serum or urine. The conduct of HIV testing of individuals must address: Confidentiality: The entire process of testing and results are kept confidential to give boost to individuals, couples, and families to learn about  their HIV status in the convenience and privacy of their home environment. Window period: There is a period of time between HIV infection and the appearance of anti-HIV antibodies that can be measured which is called "window period". CD4 count: CD4 cells are a type of white blood cell that's specifically targeted and destroyed by HIV. Rapid or point-of-care tests: The rapid test is an immunoassay used for screening, and it produces quick results, in 20 minutes or less. Rapid tests use blood or oral fluid to look for antibodies to HIV. ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay): ELISA is set of blood tests used to diagnose HIV infection.  ELISA test is performed by inserting a needle to draw blood. RNA tests : It detects the virus directly (instead of the antibodies to HIV) and thus can detect HIV at about 10 days after infection, as soon as it appears in the bloodstream, before antibodies develop. Western Blot: A positive ELISA test is always followed by a Western blot test which confirm HIV infection.
