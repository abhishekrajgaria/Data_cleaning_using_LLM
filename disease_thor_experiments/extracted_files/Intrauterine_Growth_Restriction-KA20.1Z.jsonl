#Complication - Intrauterine Growth Restriction - KA20.1Z
IUGR causes many health problems during pregnancy, delivery, and after birth. These include: Difficulty during vaginal delivery, Low Apgar scores, Meconium aspiration, low birth weight, Hypoglycemia, High red blood cell count, Low resistance to infection, Difficulty in maintaining body temperature.
#Causes - Intrauterine Growth Restriction - KA20.1Z
IUGR has many causes related to mother, foetus and placenta (part that joins the mother and foetus). Symmetric or primary IUGR is due to genetic or chromosomal causes, early gestational intrauterine infections (TORCH) and maternal alcohol use. Asymmetric IUGR is more commonly due to extrinsic influences that affect the foetus later in gestation, such as preeclampsia, chronic hypertension, and uterine anomalies.
#Diagnosis - Intrauterine Growth Restriction - KA20.1Z
One of the most important things when diagnosing IUGR is to know accurate gestational age of baby. Gestational age can be calculated by using the first day of last menstrual period (LMP) and also by early ultrasound calculations. Once the gestational age is known the following methods can be used to diagnose IUGR: Fundal height, Weight checkups, Ultrasound, Doppler assessment.
#Overview - Intrauterine Growth Restriction - KA20.1Z
Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is a common complication of pregnancy in developing countries, and carries an increased risk of perinatal mortality and morbidity. IUGR refers to a condition in which foetus (an unborn baby) is smaller or less developed than normal for the baby's gender and gestational age. Gestational age is the age of a foetus or baby that starts on the first day of the mother's last menstrual period. When IUGR infants grow up long-term complications include growth retardation, neurodevelopment defects may occur.
#Prevention - Intrauterine Growth Restriction - KA20.1Z
Although IUGR can occur even when a mother is perfectly healthy, still there are some measures to reduce the risk of IUGR and increase the chances of a healthy pregnancy and baby. Care before pregnancy: Providing care to women before and between pregnancies (inter-conception care) improves the chances of mothers and babies being healthy. Diagnosis and management of chronic diseases such as hypertension, diabetes before pregnancy. Care during pregnancy: Pregnant mothers should take only those medicines which are prescribed by doctors. Pregnant women are advised to take enough rest with proper duration of sleep during night and an hour or two of rest in the afternoon. Care during delivery: Delivery should be planned in health facilities having emergency obstetric care and neonatal care facilities.
#Riskfactor - Intrauterine Growth Restriction - KA20.1Z
Various risk factors for IUGR can be summarized as: A. Maternal causes: Before pregnancy: Low pre-pregnancy weight and small maternal size; Low socioeconomic status; Recent pregnancy. During pregnancy: Poor weight gain during pregnancy, especially in latter half; Chronic illness - such as malabsorption, diabetes, renal disease; Decreased oxygen availability such as in high altitude, severe maternal anemia. B. Uterine and placental factors: Inadequate placental growth; Uterine malformations; Multiple gestations. C. Fetal causes include familial genetic and chromosomal abnormalities and intrauterine infections such as TORCH- which includes toxoplasmosis, other infections (syphilis, varicella-zoster, parvovirus B19), rubella, cytomegalovirus (CMV), and herpes infections.
#Symptoms - Intrauterine Growth Restriction - KA20.1Z
The main symptom of IUGR is a small for gestational age baby. During the antenatal checkup, a doctor measures the height of the uterus from the pubic bone to estimate the size of the fetus. After about the 20th week, uterine fundal height in centimeters is usually equal to the number of weeks of the pregnancy. A lag in fundal height of 4 cm or more with weeks of pregnancy suggests IUGR, and additional tests are required to confirm diagnosis. At term birth, symptoms of IUGR are: Baby is small all over or malnourished, Thin, pale, loose and dry skin, Umbilical cord is thin and often stained with meconium.
#Treatment - Intrauterine Growth Restriction - KA20.1Z
General management measures: These include treatment of maternal disease, good nutrition and advice for bed rest. Preterm delivery is indicated if the fetus shows evidence of abnormal function on biophysical profile testing. Antenatal administration of steroids in preterm pregnancies and delivery at an institution with an emergency obstetric care and neonatal care unit is advised. The foetus should be monitored continuously during labor to minimize fetal hypoxia.
