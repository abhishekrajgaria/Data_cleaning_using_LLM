#Complication - Stroke - 8B20
There are complications that can arise as a result of stroke, many of which are life threatening.Some of these complications are as follows: Dysphagia: The damage caused by a stroke can interrupt normal swallowing reflex, making it possible for small particles of food to enter respiratory tract (windpipe). Hydrocephalus: Hydrocephalus is a condition that occurs when there is too much cerebrospinal fluid in the cavities (ventricles) of the brain. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Some people with the stroke might  experience a further blood clot in their leg, known as deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
#Diagnosis - Stroke - 8B20
Strokes is primarily a clinical diagnosis, supported by  brain imaging. CT scans and MRI: Two common methods used for brain imaging are a computer tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Swallowing test: A swallow test is essential for a person who has had a stroke. Brain Angiography: This is done to take images of the blood vessels of the brain. This can be done using CT (CT angiography), MRA (MR angiography) or injecting dye called catheter angiography. Echocardiogram: In some cases an echocardiogram may be used to produce images of the heart using an ultrasound probe placed on the chest (transthoracic echocardiogram).
#Overview - Stroke - 8B20
Stroke (also known as Brain Attack) occurs when blood supply to the  brain is affected due to either blockage or leakage (or both blockage and leakage)  of a blood vessel responsible for supplying or draining blood to and from  the brain, thereby, causing brain damage leading to difficulty in movements, sensation, speaking, vision etc. or at times to death. Types of stroke: Ischemic Stroke, Hemorrhagic Stroke, Intracerebral hemorrhage, Subarachnoid hemorrhage.
#Prevention - Stroke - 8B20
Stroke is a condition for which the statement ‘Prevention is better than cure’ is perfect and holds good. Four lifestyle factors which help in prevention are avoiding tobacco use (smoking or chewing), alcohol excess, taking balanced diet (low salt, high vegetable and fruit content) and maintaining adequate physical activity (minimum 30 minutes brisk walking for five days in a week). Four medical conditions to keep under control are high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high body fat (cholesterol or weight control) and heart diseases. Heart disease, particularly with irregular heartbeat may require a blood thinner to prevent stroke. Warning leaks may require angiography and appropriate treatment to prevent subarachnoid haemorrhage. 
#Riskfactor - Stroke - 8B20
Presence of following risk factors place people at increased risk for developing stroke. A.Non-modifiable: Family history. Old age. Male sex. B.Modifiable: High blood pressure. Diabetes. High cholesterol. Heart disease. Smoking (as it injures the blood vessels and speeds up the hardening of the arteries). Consuming excessive alcohol (as it increases the blood pressure). Low socioeconomic status.
#Symptoms - Stroke - 8B20
Stroke can affect any movement, senses, speech, behavior, thoughts, memory, and emotions. The body may become paralyzed or weak. The five most common symptoms of stroke are: Weakness or Numbness of the face, arm, or leg. Confusion or trouble speaking or understanding others. Difficulty in vision. Difficulty in walking or loss of balance or coordination. Severe headache with unknown cause.
#Treatment - Stroke - 8B20
All patients need good supportive care in a stroke unit, looked after by physicians, nurses, physiotherapists, Speech therapists, Occupational therapists with help from Radiologists, Neurosurgeons and others with interest in stroke. Ischemic stroke: Blockage of a blood vessel, the root cause of ischemic stroke, can be cleared by injection of ‘clot-busters’ like t-PA into the patient’s forearm veins, but this is successful only in one third of patients who receive this injection within three hours of start of stroke. Brain Haemorrhage  Intra-cerebral haemorrhage: Many patients require surgery for removal of the large blood clot causing life-threatening increase in pressure inside the skull. Rest of the treatment is similar to that of ischemic stroke. Subarachnoid haemorrhage: Often, this is due to a sac like bulge from a blood vessel (called an aneurysm), which has a tendency of life-threatening re-bleeding, which requires surgery or angiography with coiling to prevent re-bleeding.
