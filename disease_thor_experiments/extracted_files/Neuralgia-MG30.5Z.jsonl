#Diagnosis - Neuralgia - MG30.5Z
Diagnosis of neuralgia can be difficult at times. It can be diagnosed with the help of tests like: Laser evoked potentials: Laser evoked potentials (LEPs) are used to measure cortical responses to selectively stimulate thermonociceptors in the skin. Punch skin biopsyz: Recently, skin biopsy has also been used to investigate mechanoreceptors and their myelinated afferents. Though available in only a few research centers, skin punch biopsy is an easy procedure and is minimally invasive.
#Causes - Neuralgia - MG30.5Z
Causes of neuralgia include: Chemical irritation, Chronic renal insufficiency, Diabetes, Infections, such as herpes zoster ( shingles), HIV, Lyme disease, and syphilis, Pressure on nerves by nearby bones, ligaments, blood vessels, or tumours, Trauma (including surgery).
#Overview - Neuralgia - MG30.5Z
Neuralgia is pain in one or more nerves caused by a change in neurological structure or function of the nerves rather than by excitation of healthy pain receptors. Trigeminal neuralgia can be divided into different categories depending on the type of pain. These are described below. Trigeminal neuralgia type 1 (TN1) is the classic form of trigeminal neuralgia. Trigeminal neuralgia type 2 (TN2) can be referred to as atypical (not typical) trigeminal neuralgia. Symptomatic trigeminal neuralgia (STN) is when pain results from an underlying cause, such as multiple sclerosis.
#Symptoms - Neuralgia - MG30.5Z
The main symptom of neuralgia is a sudden severe stabbing or piercing pain in the area of distribution of concerned nerve. It can be due to irritation or damage to the nerve. Increased sensitivity of the skin in area of distribution of the damaged nerve, so that any touch or pressure is felt as pain. Numbness along the path of the nerve. Weakness or complete paralysis of muscles supplied by the same nerve.
#Treatment - Neuralgia - MG30.5Z
Treatment include both medicines and surgery, Anticonvulsant medicines: They are used to block nerve pathways and tricyclic antidepressants are generally effective in treating neuralgia. Surgery: Neural augmentative surgery is used to stimulate the affected nerve. Electrodes are carefully placed in the dorsal root and subcutaneous nerve stimulation is used to stimulate the targeted nerve pathway.
