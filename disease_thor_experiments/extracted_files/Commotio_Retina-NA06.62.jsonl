#Complications - Commotio Retina - NA06.62
There may be complications due to associated injuries such as macular hole, retinal tears, choroidal rupture, hyphaema, lens dislocation, late development of cataract, glaucoma or retinal tears, or chorioretinal atrophy.
#Causes - Commotio Retina - NA06.62
Commotio retinae is caused due to pressure waves emanating from blunt trauma to the eye resulting in retinal injury. There may also be associated choroidal rupture or retinal haemorrhage. Following acute episode of oedema, retina may develop scarring and pigment dispersal. Macular commotio retinae reduces central vision. The vision usually improves on resolution of oedema, unless there is development of macular hole or disruption of retinal pigment epithelium of the fovea. Studies suggest that commotio retinae is probably caused due to disruption of the photoreceptor outer segments, and is not a true extracellular oedema.
#Diagnosis - Commotio Retina - NA06.62
Diagnosis depends upon the history of injury to the eye and clinical features. Investigations: Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT): Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) suggests and confirms that the major site of retinal trauma appears to be at the level of photoreceptor outer segment and retinal pigment epithelium interface. Fundus Fluorescein Angiography (FFA): Fundus Fluorescein Angiography may show early blockage in areas of white retina and no alteration in vascular permeability. There may be leakage of fluorescein dye with associated retinal pigment epithelium changes. A ‘salt and pepper’ fundus may be seen in cases with more severe injury. Differential diagnosis includes: Traumatic macular hole, Choroidal rupture, Retinal artery occlusion, Retinal detachment, Purtscher retinopathy.
#Overview - Commotio Retina - NA06.62
Commotio Retinae or Berlin’s Oedema is grey-white discolouration of the retina due to disruption of outer segment photoreceptor layer following blunt trauma. This is caused due to contrecoup injury. Shock waves caused due to impact traverses the fluid- filled eye and then strike retina. Commotio retinae or Berlin’s oedema was first described by a German physician, Rudolph Berlin in the year 1873, as a transient grey-white opacification of the macular/ peripheral retina following blunt trauma to eye.
#Treatment - Commotio Retina - NA06.62
There is no approved medical therapy for commotio retinae. The patient should be observed closely during first few days to weeks following trauma, to monitor development of any complication and its treatment thereof. The cases which do not resolve spontaneously may be tried with intravenous steroids. This may reduce retinal swelling and thus may help in improvement of vision. Prognosis: Most patients recover spontaneously, but some with more severe trauma may remain visually impaired with reduced vision or paracentral scotoma. Most of the cases resolve within four weeks of injury, although some improvement may continue for up to even six weeks. Some patients have permanent macular damage with absolute or relative scotoma. Patients with involvement of macular area have poor prognosis.
#Symptoms - Commotio Retina - NA06.62
Symptoms of Commotio retinae may be: Acute diminution of vision, Permanent diminution of vision.
