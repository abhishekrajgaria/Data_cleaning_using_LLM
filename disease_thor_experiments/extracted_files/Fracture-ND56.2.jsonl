#Complications - Fracture - ND56.2
Mal union: This occurs either when the fracture heals in the wrong position or it shifts (the fracture itself shifts). Interruption of bone growth: If during childhood bone fracture affects both ends of bones, there is a risk that the normal development of that bone may be affected, raising the risk of a subsequent deformity. Persistent bone or bone marrow infection: If there is a break in the skin. Bone death (Avascular necrosis): If the bone loses its essential supply of blood it may die.
#Causes - Fracture - ND56.2
The fractures are generally caused due to fall with a great impact or road accident. Healthy bones are extremely tough and resilient and can withstand powerful impacts. When people enter old age two factors make their risk of fractures greater; weaker bones and a greater risk of falling. Children are physically more active than adults, thus they are more prone to accidents or fall that may result in fractures. People with debilitating illnesses and conditions that may weaken their bones also have a higher risk of fractures. Examples include osteoporosis, infection or a tumor.
#Diagnosis - Fracture - ND56.2
A fractured bone can be diagnosed clinically based on the history and the physical examination of the patient. Imaging by X-ray is often performed to view the bone suspected of being fractured. In certain suitations, x-ray alone is not sufficient, a computed tomograph (CT scan) or MRI may be performed.
#Overview - Fracture - ND56.2
Fracture is a medical condition which leads to break in the continuity of the bone. A bone fracture can be the result due to high force impact or stress, or trivial injury as a result of certain medical conditions that weaken the bones, such as osteoporosis, bone cancer, or osteogenesis imperfecta, where the fracture is then properly termed a pathologic fracture. Classification: Traumatic fracture, Pathological fracture, Closed (simple) fractures, Open (compound) fractures, Complete fracture, Incomplete fracture, Linear fracture, Transverse fracture, Oblique fracture, Spiral fracture, Comminuted fracture, Impacted fracture, Avulsion fracture.
#Prevention - Fracture - ND56.2
Nutrition and sunlight: The human body needs adequate supplies of calcium for healthy bones. Milk, cheese, yoghurt and dark green leafy vegetables are good sources of calcium. Physical activity: The more weight-bearing exercises the person does, the stronger and denser their bones will be. Examples include skipping, walking, running, and dancing any exercise where the body pulls on the skeleton. The (female) menopause: Hormones estrogen, which regulates a woman's calcium, starts to drop and continues to do so until after the menopause.
#Symptoms - Fracture - ND56.2
Fractures can cause: Pain and bleeding, Swelling, Bruising or discolored skin around the affected area, The patient is unable to put weight on the injured area, The patient cannot move the affected area. If it is an open fracture there may be: Bleeding, Damage to adjacent structures such as nerves or vessels, spinal cord and nerve roots (for spine fractures), or cranial contents (for skull fractures) can cause other specific signs and symptoms.
#Treatment - Fracture - ND56.2
Closed fractures is reduced with or without anesthesia and then reduced. Treatment of bone fractures are broadly classified as surgical or conservative: Conservative approach Fracture treatment is usually aimed at making sure there is the best possible function of the injured part after healing. Plaster casts or plastic functional braces: these hold the bone in position until it has healed. Metal plates and screws: current procedures use minimally invasive techniques. ntra-medullary nails: Internal steel rods are placed down the center of long bones. External fixators: these may be made of metal or carbon fiber; they have steel pins that go into the bone directly through the skin. They are a type of scaffolding outside the body. Pain management: Pain killers like ibuprofen, diclofenac is used to relieve pain. Physiotherapy: Once the fracture is healed it is necessary to restore muscle strength as well as mobility to the affected area. Surgery approach: Bone grafting: Bone grafting is a surgical procedure that replaces missing bone in order to repair bone fractures that are extremely complex, pose a major health risk to the patient, or fail to heal properly.
