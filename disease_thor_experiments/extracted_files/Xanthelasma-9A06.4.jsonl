#Causes - Xanthelasma - 9A06.4
The aetiology of xanthelasma is not known. Xanthelasma was considered previously to be a degenerative condition, which involved the subcutaneous and muscular tissue. Now, most agree that this condition occurs as an isolated disorder. Few patients give a family history of xanthelasma. Xanthelasma may occur as a result of: Hyperlipidaemia, Hypercholesterolemia, Obesity, Cardiovascular diseases.
#Symptoms - Xanthelasma - 9A06.4
Patients present with Xanthelasma on the lids thereby disfiguring the face. Xanthelasma appear as one or more, flat or minimally elevated, placoid, yellowish lesions, affecting skin of eyelids, more commonly on the medial aspect of the lids. It is often bilateral and symmetrical. Sometimes, xanthelasmas coalesce and form raised, large nodular or plaque like lesions. Elevated and nodular xanthelasma present as tuberous xanthoma.
#Treatment - Xanthelasma - 9A06.4
Management should be carried out under medical supervision. Patients are treated systemically for any rise in serum lipid levels with lipid-lowering agents. Sometimes, such systemic therapy alone brings about resolution of xanthelasma. Surgical therapy is considered for larger or cosmetically unacceptable lesions. After excision, wound may be allowed to heal as such or it is stitched. Laser treatment may also provide benefit in xanthelasma. There is high rate of recurrence of disease.
#Diagnosis - Xanthelasma - 9A06.4
Diagnosis is usually clinical. Lipid biochemistry: Although xanthelasmas are commonly thought to be associated with hyperlipidaemia, many patients have normal plasma cholesterol levels. However, these patients may have abnormalities in lipoprotein patterns. Other diagnosis Hidradenomas or syringomas, Actinic elastosis with cysts and comedones, Milia, Necrobiotic xanthogranuloma.
#Overview - Xanthelasma - 9A06.4
Xanthelasma (xanthelasma palpebrarum) is a raised, yellow, soft, plaque-like, velvety lesion most commonly seen in the medial canthal (inner junction between upper and lower eyelid) area of the eyelid. It is a common subcutaneous eyelid lesion. It tends to be bilateral and is more common in the elderly. It has slightly more female preponderance. Xanthelasma is known to occur as a result of hyperlipidaemia, hypercholesterolemia, obesity and cardiovascular diseases. Although some patients with xanthelasma have normal lipid levels, others may show hyperlipidaemia (usually type II) or secondary hyperlipidaemia owing to conditions such as biliary cirrhosis or diabetes mellitus.
