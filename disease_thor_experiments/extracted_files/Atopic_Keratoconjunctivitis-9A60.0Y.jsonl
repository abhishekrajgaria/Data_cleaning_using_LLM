#Causes - Atopic Keratoconjunctivitis - 9A60.0Y
Atopic keratoconjunctivitis is a chronic allergic conjunctivitis and may be due to: Hypersensitivity response: All ocular allergic disorders are characterised by a hypersensitivity response, defined as an excessive reaction of the normal immune system, usually by exposure to an inciting antigen. Genetic predisposition: A genetic predisposition combined with antigen sensitisation is suspected in AKC and its associated disease, atopic dermatitis. AKC may, however, represent either a common manifestation end point for a number of abnormal gene processes, or a single gene defect with variable phenotypic expression, modified by other gene polymorphisms and the environment. Epithelial barrier defect: More recent studies suggest that an epithelial barrier defect may be responsible rather than a defect in immune-regulatory function.
#Complications - Atopic Keratoconjunctivitis - 9A60.0Y
AKC may be associated with complications/ features like: Ptosis, Tylosis (thickening of eyelid margin), Staphylococcal blepharitis, Conjunctival fornix foreshortening, Keratopathy, Keratoconus, Recurrent herpes simplex keratitis, Corneal scarring, Corneal thinning, Corneal perforation, Pellucid marginal degeneration, Anterior sub-capsular cataract, Posterior sub-capsular cataract, Degenerative vitreous changes, Retinal detachment.
#Diagnosis - Atopic Keratoconjunctivitis - 9A60.0Y
Diagnosis of AKC is based upon typical clinical features. Despite facts suggesting immune responses in the pathogenesis of VKC, no clinical or laboratory test has evolved to support the diagnosis in atypical cases or predict the course of disease. History of atopy in patient or the family, elevated serum level of total and specific IgE, higher number of eosinophils and mast cells, increased level of mediators and favourable response to anti-allergic therapy is observed in AKC.


#Overview - Atopic Keratoconjunctivitis - 9A60.0Y
Atopic keratoconjunctivitis (AKC) is a relatively uncommon, but potentially blinding ocular (eye) disease, which typically affects young people with atopic dermatitis.  AKC is a severe chronic inflammatory disease of the conjunctiva which may have dramatic consequences for visual function. The incidence of atopic dermatitis is greatest in paediatric population. AKC may occur at any time after the onset of the associated dermatitis or other atopic condition, and is not necessarily correlated with exacerbations of these conditions. The initial presentation of ocular symptoms in AKC most commonly occurs in the second to third decade of life, with some patients presenting earlier or later (range varies from late teens to 50 years with peak age of incidence in people aged 30-50 years). Visually significant complications most frequently occur in the fourth to fifth decades, with more men affected than women. The condition then remains chronic for years, usually requiring lifelong treatment. An earlier onset of AKC carries the greatest risk for tear film abnormalities and greater ocular surface damage. Classically involved skin areas of atopic dermatitis are lateral neck folds, antecubital (in-front of the elbow) and popliteal (back of knee joint) fossae, but may involve other parts of body including eyelid.
#Prevention - Atopic Keratoconjunctivitis - 9A60.0Y
For optimal long term prevention of AKC, reduce or eliminate the exposure to environmental allergen. Mast cell stabilisers and antihistamines are the mainstay of prophylactic therapy. Reduction of environmental allergens along with oral and topical antihistamines helps in management of exacerbations.
#Symptoms - Atopic Keratoconjunctivitis - 9A60.0Y
Unlike SAC, symptoms of AKC are usually present year-round, though a significant number of patients may have seasonal exacerbations. Ocular symptoms of AKC: Moderate to severe Itching, Tearing of eyes, Irritation, Burning sensation, Dermatitis of eyelids and peri-orbital skin, Peri-orbital hyper-pigmentation, Chronic eyelid oedema and inflammation, Entropion (inward turning of eyelid), Ptosis (drooping of upper eyelid), Lagophthalmos (incomplete or defective closure of eyelids), Madarosis (loss of eyelashes), Redness of eyes, Stringy mucoid discharge, Difficulty in opening the eyes on awakening, Discomfort in eyes, Photophobia (sensitivity to light), Pain, Blurring of vision.
#Treatment - Atopic Keratoconjunctivitis - 9A60.0Y
Management should be carried out under medical supervision. Because of chronic nature of AKC, the balance of treatment efficacy and risk is often difficult. AKC is generally less responsive and requires more intensive and prolonged treatment. The approach to management is multifaceted with the purpose of improving patient comfort and preventing the complications associated with AKC. Management involves multiple treatment arms viz. topical mast cell stabilisers, corticosteroids, steroid-sparing immunosuppressive agents such as topical cyclosporine. In more severe cases, systemic immune-suppression may be required.
