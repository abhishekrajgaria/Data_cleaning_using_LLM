#Complications - Hypervitaminosis A - 5B90.0
Besides clinical symptoms, patient may have complications such as: Bone abnormalities, Swelling of bones, Hepatomegaly, Splenomegaly, Raised intracranial pressure, Stupor, Limited body movement, Cirrhosis of liver.
#Causes - Hypervitaminosis A - 5B90.0
Hypervitaminosis A is usually caused by chronic and excessive intake, generally for weeks or months together, of preformed vitamin A (as retinol or its estrified form). Excessive use of food supplements containing vitamin A, or food fads of intake of organ meat may be the cause. Excessive intake of carotenes is not associated with toxicity but may result in yellow colouration of skin (carotenodermia) and increased serum levels (carotenaemia). Acute hypervitaminosis A may result due to consumption of a single large dose of about 30- 60 mg of vitamin A.
#Overview - Hypervitaminosis A - 5B90.0
Hypervitaminosis A usually results from chronic and excessive intake, generally for weeks or months together, of preformed vitamin A (as retinol or its esterified form). Excessive use of food supplements containing vitamin A, or food fads of intake of organ meat may be the cause. Toxicity is produced with chronic intake of 6000μg of vitamin A in children, and 15000μg of vitamin A in adults.
#Diagnosis - Hypervitaminosis A - 5B90.0
Young children with acute hypervitaminosis A may show papilloedema and symptoms suggestive of pseudo-tumour cerebri. Infants of mothers, who consumed excess of vitamin A for treatment of cancer or acne, may show craniofacial abnormalities. Radiographs may show hyperostosis affecting long bones, especially affecting middle of the shafts. It is different from cortical hyperostosis. Serum levels of vitamin A are raised. There may be hypercalcaemia. Excessive intake of carotenes may produce yellow colouration of skin (carotenodermia) and increased serum (carotenaemia) levels. This is more significant in children with liver disease, hypothyroidism, or diabetes mellitus.
#Symptoms - Hypervitaminosis A - 5B90.0
Patient may present with symptoms such as: Headache, Anorexia, Vomiting, Desquamation of skin, Seborrhoea, Cheilosis (fissuring at the angle of mouth), Coarse hair, Alopecia, Swelling of bones, Diplopia (double vision), Irritability, Lack of gain in weight, Pruritus (itching), Bulging fontanelles.
#Treatment - Hypervitaminosis A - 5B90.0
There is no antidote for hypervitaminosis A. Symptoms of hypervitaminosis A may subside rapidly on withdrawal of vitamin, but the rate at which improvement takes place depends upon the amount of vitamin A already built up in the tissues. Hypervitaminosis A may prove fatal in extreme cases. Thus, prevention plays an important role in avoiding toxicity.
