#Diagnosis - Diabetic Retinopathy - 9B71.0Z
Patients have increased fasting and postprandial (taken two hours after meals) blood sugar levels. Glycosylated or glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) is a measure of glycaemic control over the last three months. Laboratory tests for Diabetic Retinopathy:  Fluorescein Angiography (FA): Fluorescein is a fluorescent dye. Fluorescein Angiography helps in assessing degree of retinal ischaemia and delineates retinal vascular abnormalities.  Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT): OCT generates cross-sectional image of the retina with light. OCT helps in measuring retinal thickening. Periodic OCT determine whether the retinal thickening in macular area due to oedema is regressing or not with treatment. B-scan ultrasonography: B-scan ultrasonography evaluates retina when the media is not clear e.g. vitreous haemorrhage. Diabetic retinopathy should be distinguished from conditions like retinal vein occlusion, retinal vasculitis, sickle cell retinopathy or ocular ischaemic syndrome.
#Overview - Diabetic Retinopathy - 9B71.0Z
Diabetes mellitus is caused due to lack or diminished effectiveness of endogenous insulin and is characterised by hyperglycaemia. There are two broad types: Type I: This is known as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). It is characterised by insulin deficiency. Usually it has juvenile onset but may occur at any age. Type II: This is known as non insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) or maturity onset diabetes mellitus. It occurs in middle aged/ older people who are often obese. Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is characterised by changes in retinal blood vessels that occur in patients with diabetes mellitus. Central retina or macular area is located between main superior and inferior retinal artery and vein. Diabetic retinopathy is broadly divided as: Background Diabetic retinopathy. Pre-proliferative Diabetic retinopathy. Proliferative Diabetic retinopathy (PDR).
#Symptoms - Diabetic Retinopathy - 9B71.0Z
Patients are generally asymptomatic in the initial stages of the disease. In advanced stages of disease, patient may experience: Blurring of vision, Progressive reduction of visual acuity, Fluctuation of vision, Presence of floaters, Distortion of images, Flashes of light (photopsia), Defects in the field of vision.
#Riskfactor - Diabetic Retinopathy - 9B71.0Z
Risk factors for development of Diabetic retinopathy: Duration of Diabetes: Probability and incidence of developing Diabetic retinopathy is related to the duration of Diabetes. This is the most important factor. Control of Diabetes: Though control of Diabetes mellitus will not prevent Diabetic retinopathy, it delays development by few years. Other factors having adverse effect on DR: These include: Systemic hypertension. Pregnancy. Renal disease. Anaemia.
#Treatment - Diabetic Retinopathy - 9B71.0Z
It should be strictly carried out under medical supervision. Drug therapy for Diabetic retinopathy: Intravitreal triamcinolone: Intravitreal injection of triamcinolone may be used in cases of Diabetic macular oedema. Intravitreal Anti-Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (Anti-VEGF): Intravitreal  injection of Anti-VEGF help in reducing diabetic macular oedema, NVD and NVE. Laser Photocoagulation for Diabetic retinopathy: Direct laser photocoagulation: Laser burns are applied to microaneurysms and micro-vascular lesions in the center of hard exudates located  between 500µm to 3000µm from center of the fovea. Grid photocoagulation: Grid photocoagulation is applied in areas of diffuse retinal thickening located at posterior pole of eye, 500µm each from the center of the fovea and from the temporal margin of the optic disc. Pre-proliferative Diabetic retinopathy: Photocoagulation is done when fluorescein angiography shows extensive areas of capillary non-perfusion in patients who had proliferative DR in the fellow eye. Surgical management in the form of pars plana vitrectomy may be done in complicated cases like persistent vitreous haemorrhage, tractional retinal detachment or rubeosis iridis.
