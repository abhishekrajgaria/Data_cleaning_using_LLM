#Causes - Hypermetropia - 9D00.1
Hypermetropia may be: Axial hypermetropia: Axial hypermetropia is the commonest type. Curvature hypermetropia: Curvature hypermetropia is that condition in which curvature of the cornea, lens or both is increased (flatter) than the normal, resulting in change in refractive power of the eye. Index Hypermetropia: Index Hypermetropia occurs due to change in refractive index of the crystalline lens with age. Positional hypermetropia: Positional hypermetropia results from posteriorly placed crystalline lens of the eye. Absence of crystalline lens: Absence of crystalline lens either congenital absence or acquired (following surgical removal or posterior displacement) leads to aphakia.
#Complication - Hypermetropia - 9D00.1
Uncorrected hypermetropia may produce complications such as: Accommodative convergent squint: Excessive use of accommodation may produce accommodative convergent squint, usually by the age of about 2- 3 years. Amblyopia: Amblyopia may develop as: Anisometropic amblyopia, Strabismic amblyopia, Ametropic amblyopia. Lid diseases: Repeated rubbing of eyes in hypermetropic blurred vision may produce blepharitis, stye or chalazion. Primary narrow angle glaucoma: The eye in hypermetropia is proportionately small.
#Diagnosis - Hypermetropia - 9D00.1
Diagnosis of hypermetropia is based on the symptoms and clinical signs observed. Clinical signs: Visual acuity, Cover test, Eyelids, Eyeball, Cornea, Anterior chamber, Glaucoma, Lens, Fundus, Ultrasonography or biometry. Clinical types of hypermetropia: Simple hypermetropia, Pathological hypermetropia, Functional hypermetropia.
#Overview - Hypermetropia - 9D00.1
Hypermetropia (hyperopia, long-sightedness or far- sightedness) is a form of refractive error in which parallel rays of light coming from infinity are focused behind the light sensitive layer of the retina, when the eye is at rest. Donders (1864) discusses in his historical review about hypermetropia. Much of the problem was caused by confusion between the effects of presbyopia and hypermetropia on near vision. Small hypermetropia may be corrected by voluntary accommodation. Even high errors of refraction may be corrected this way, but convex glasses may be required if symptoms are not relieved.
#Symptoms - Hypermetropia - 9D00.1
The symptoms vary depending upon the age of the patient and the severity of refractive error. Patient may be asymptomatic. Symptomatic patients may present with: When hypermetropia is fully corrected: Asthenopia (eyestrain). Frontal or fronto-temporal headache. Watering. Mild aversion to light. When hypermetropia is not fully corrected: Asthenopia. Defective vision more for near. When hypermetropia is high: Marked defective vision for both near and distance. When there is more of absolute hypermetropia: Blurring of vision at a younger age than in emmetrope.When there is Spasm of accommodation: Intermittent sudden blurring of vision.
#Treatment - Hypermetropia - 9D00.1
Medical optical therapy: Assessment of Vision: The most common component of assessment of visual function is to test central vision through visual acuity. Visual acuity determines ability to read symbols of varying sizes at a standard testing distance. Basic principle of therapy is to converge and focus the light rays on the retina with the help of convex (plus) glasses. Surgical therapy: It may be: Non- contact Holmium:YAG laser thermokeratoplasty, Hypermetropic photorefractive keratectomy (H- PRK), Conductive keratoplasty, Hypermetropic laser assisted in- situ keratomileusis (LASIK), Phakic intraocular lens (IOL) implants, Refractive lens exchange.
