#Complications - Dacryocystitis - 9A11.2
Dacryocystitis may lead to complications like: Lacrimal sac abscess, Fistula formation, Orbital cellulitis, Cavernous sinus thrombosis, Meningitis.
#Causes - Dacryocystitis - 9A11.2
The causative agents for dacryocystitis may be: In children: Staphylococcus aureus, Î²-haemolytic streptococcus, Pneumococcus, Haemophilus influenzae. In adults: Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Pneumococcus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Fusobacterium.
#Diagnosis - Dacryocystitis - 9A11.2
Laboratory diagnosis: Following tests may be conducted for dacryocystitis: Examination of smear of discharge from the eye. Culture and sensitivity of the discharge from the eye. Blood culture. Imaging studies: Plain X-ray: Plain X-ray may help in diagnosing skeletal abnormality or any foreign body as a causative factor. CT scan: CT scan is useful in suspected cases of occult malignancy or mass. Dacryocystography (DCG): Radiographs are taken after injecting contrast medium into canaliculi. Subtraction DCG with CT scan: DCG is done by obtaining bone-free images by subtraction for better delineation. Lacrimal Scintillography: Tears are labelled with technetium-99m and its progress is monitored through drainage system to look for any abnormality.
#Overview - Dacryocystitis - 9A11.2
Dacryocystitis is an inflammation affecting lacrimal sac. Lacrimal excretory system drain tears from eye to the nasal cavity. Stagnation of tears due to blockage of lacrimal drainage system can result in dacryocystitis. Lacrimal drainage system consists of: Punctum (plural puncta): Punctum is located near the medial (inner) end of each eyelid and it joins vertical canaliculus. Vertical canaliculus (plural canaliculi): Vertical canaliculus, also known as ampulla (plural ampulae) is about 2mm in length and it continues with horizontal canaliculus. Horizontal canaliculus: Horizontal canaliculus is about 8mm in length. Canaliculus from upper and lower eyelid joins to form common canaliculus in about 90% of cases. Lacrimal sac: Lacrimal sac is about 10mm long and lies in lacrimal fossa near medial canthus (where upper and lower lid meet internally) of the eye. It continues as nasolacrimal duct. Nasolacrimal duct: Nasolacrimal duct is about 12mm long and joins lacrimal sac with the nasal cavity (nasolacrimal duct opens into the inferior meatus of the nose).
#Treatment - Dacryocystitis - 9A11.2
Management should be carried out under medical supervision. Congenital dacryocystitis: Local massage over lacrimal sac: This is carried out by blocking the common canaliculus with finger and then stroking downward to increase hydrostatic pressure within lacrimal sac, which may open the membranous obstruction in the nasolacrimal duct. Topical and/or systemic antibiotics for superadded infection. Probing and syringing: Probing is done to open obstructive membrane near lower end of nasolacrimal duct in cases in which the duct does not open spontaneously. Syringing is performed after probing. Antibiotic drops are prescribed after syringing. Probing may be repeated in cases which do not improve. Dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR): DCR is a surgical procedure (external approach done through skin) in which a communication is made between medial wall of lacrimal sac and the nasal cavity, for drainage. This is done in failed cases of probing.
#Symptoms - Dacryocystitis - 9A11.2
The patient usually present with: Congenital dacryocystitis: The lower end of nasolacrimal duct may be non-canalised at birth. It gets canalised on its own in most of the cases during first few weeks of life. During non-canalised period, child may have symptoms like: Watering from the eye. Mucopurulent discharge from the eyes, if there is superadded infection due to blockage.
