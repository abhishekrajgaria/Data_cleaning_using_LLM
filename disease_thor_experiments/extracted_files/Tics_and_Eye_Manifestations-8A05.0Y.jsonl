#Causes - Tics and Eye Manifestations - 8A05.0Y
The aetiology of tics is not known. Genetic: A positive family history of tics is seen in about one-half of patients. A complex genetic aetiology is supported by estimates of familial risk and heritability of tic disorders. Tic disorders are a subcategory of neuro-developmental disorders in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-5 (DSM-5). There is a possible association of tic expression with situational or contextual factors. Tics may both be exacerbated or attenuated by antecedents and consequences which may be either internal state or external stimuli.
