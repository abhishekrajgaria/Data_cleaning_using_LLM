#Causes - Taeniasis - 1F76.Z
Taeniasis is intestinal infection caused by two species of tapeworms Taenia solium (pork tapeworm) and Taenia saginata (beef tapeworm). Taeniasis is acquired by humans through the ingestion of undercooked pork or beef, infected with cysticerci or contaminated food (mainly vegetables) and water. In the human body, cysticerci develop into adult tapeworms that live in the intestine and release egg-bearing gravid proglottids (segments) which are passed with faeces. Taeniasis and (neuro) cysticercosis are common in areas where animal husbandry practices are such that pigs and cattle come into contact with human faeces.
#Diagnosis - Taeniasis - 1F76.Z
Examination of stool samples-Diagnosis of Taenia tapeworm infections can be made by examination of stool samples; Stool specimens should be collected on three different days and examined in the lab for taenia eggs using a microscope. Serological diagnosis- complement fixation tests (CFT) and indirect haemagglutination tests (IHA)] may be used for the diagnosis of cysticercosis. Neuroimaging diagnosis- Imaging methods play very important roles in the diagnosis of human cysticercosis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is considered the best neuro-imaging tool for the detection of degenerating and innocuous (viable) cysticerci. Computed tomography (CT) is the best for calcified lesions.
#Overview - Taeniasis - 1F76.Z
Taeniasis is an intestinal infection caused by adult tapeworms. Humans can get infected with two species of tapeworms-Taenia solium (pork tapeworm) and Taenia saginata (beef tapeworm). T.saginata has no major impact on human health while T. solium leads to neurocysticercosis-most severe form of the disease. Neurocysticercosis is a common cause of seizures; and the most frequent preventable cause of epilepsy worldwide. According to World Health Organization (WHO) 30% of all epilepsy cases in endemic countries and 3% epileptic cases globally may be due to neurocysticercosis.
#Treatment - Taeniasis - 1F76.Z
Treatment of taeniasis may include administration of praziquantel (single-administration) or niclosamide (single-administration) and if the patient has cysticercosis in addition to taeniasis, praziquantel should be used with caution. Praziquantel is cysticidal and can cause inflammation around dying cysts in those with cysticercosis, which may lead to seizures or other symptoms. The treatment of human cysticercosis may include long courses with praziquantel and/or albendazole, as well as supporting therapy with corticosteroids and/or anti-epileptic drugs. Ocular, ventricular, and spinal lesions may require surgical treatment because treatment with anthelmintic drugs can provoke irreversible drug-induced inflammation.
#Prevention - Taeniasis - 1F76.Z
To prevent and control T.solium infection proper public health interventions with an approach involving veterinary and human health, food safety, sanitation and environment sectors are required. Access to preventive chemotherapy: It can be implemented in three ways: Mass drug administration, Targeted chemotherapy, Selective chemotherapy. Health education. Improved sanitation. Improved pig husbandry. Anthelmintic treatment of pigs. Vaccination of pigs. Improved meat inspection.
#Symptoms - Taeniasis - 1F76.Z
A tapeworm infection does not always cause symptoms. Sometimes symptoms are mild and non-specific such as abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhoea or constipation. Neurocysticercosis is associated with different signs and symptoms depending on the number, size, stage, and location of the pathological changes as well as the host’s immune response and the parasite’s genotype. Symptoms may include chronic headaches, blindness, seizures, and dementia. Signs and symptoms of hydrocephalus, meningitis, and space occupying lesions in the central nervous system may be present. In severe cases, neurocysticercosis may be fatal.
