#Diagnosis - Mouth Breathing - MD11.8Z
Identification of the exact cause of mouth breathing is important for its treatment. Clinical and functional tests are performed to differentiate it from habitual mouth breathing. Following are the clinical tests carried out for diagnosis: Lip seal test, Mirror test, Massler’s Butterfly test, Water holding test, Rhinomanometry, Cephalometrics.
#Causes - Mouth Breathing - MD11.8Z
Enlarged nasal turbinates (network of bones in the nasal passageways) due to allergies, infections, pollution, or hot and dry climatic conditions and enlarged tonsils or adenoids. Intranasal defects such as deviated nasal septum, thickness of septum, allergic rhinitis, and nasal polyps. Hereditary. Short upper lip. Obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome.
#Overview - Mouth Breathing - MD11.8Z
Breathing is a vital function of the human body, normally done through the nose. Abnormal, habitual breathing through the mouth instead of the nose is known as mouth breathing. It is a common clinical problem in children and is detrimental to their health. Mouth breathing may be due to blockage in nasal passage, deviated nasal septum, enlarged adenoids or an infection in the nose & throat. Mouth breathers with enlarged adenoids (a mass of tissue at the back of the nasal cavity) develop “Adenoid Faces” manifested by elongated face with an expressionless and open-mouthed appearance. Mouth breathing may cause dryness of mouth leading to bad breath and gingivitis.
#Treatment - Mouth Breathing - MD11.8Z
Treatment of mouth breathing depends on its cause and should be done at an early age. Nasal congestion can be treated with the help of decongestants and nasal sprays. The child should also be examined for problems such as nasal obstructions and obstructive sleep apnoea, and should be treated accordingly. A surgery (tonsillectomy, septoplasty or adenoids removal) may be required to treat some cases of nasal obstruction. Dentists may recommend use of certain orthodontic appliances (oral screen, chin cap, activator appliance) under appliance therapy to correct malocclusion. Application of petroleum jelly on gums to prevent them from dryness and inflammation is also helpful. Habit interception appliances are recommended for the treatment of habitual mouth breathing.
