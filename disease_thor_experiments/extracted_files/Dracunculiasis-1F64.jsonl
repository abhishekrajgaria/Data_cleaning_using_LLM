#Diagnosis - Dracunculiasis - 1F64
Clinical presentation of guinea â€“worm disease is so typical and well known to local people in endemic areas that it is sufficient to make diagnosis. Examination of the fluid discharged by the worm can show rhabditiform larvae. No serologic test is available.
#Causes - Dracunculiasis - 1F64
Cause: Dracunculiasis is a parasitic disease caused by Dracunculus medinensis, a long, thread-like worm. To relieve the burning pain patients often immerse the infected part of the body in water. The worm(s) then releases thousands of larvae (baby worms) into the water. These larvae are ingested by tiny crustaceans or copepods, also called water fleas and mature in to the infective stage. People when drinking contaminated water also swallow the infected water fleas. The water fleas are killed in the stomach and the larvae are liberated. These larvae penetrate the wall of the intestine and migrate through the body.
#Overview - Dracunculiasis - 1F64
Dracunculiasis (guinea-worm disease) is a parasitic disease caused by Dracunculus medinensis that is a long, thread-like worm. Dracunculiasis is commonly known as guinea-worm disease (GW). It is transmitted exclusively when people drink stagnant water contaminated with parasite-infected water fleas (Cyclops- that carry infective guinea-worm larvae). Dracunculiasis is rarely fatal, but infected people become crippled, non-functional for weeks. It affects people in rural, deprived and isolated communities who depend mainly on open surface water sources such as ponds for drinking water. An estimated 3.5 million cases of dracunculiasis occurred during the mid-1980s in 21 countries worldwide, 17 countries of which were in Africa. The number of reported cases fell to only 22 cases globally in 2015 (lowest number of cases so far) compared with 126 cases in 2014. In 2015, cases were reported from four endemic countries - Chad (9), Mali (5), South Sudan (5) and Ethiopia (3). World Health Organization (WHO) has certified 198 countries, territories and areas (belonging to 186 Member States) as free of dracunculiasis. In India the GW disease was endemic in 89 districts in seven states. Almost two-thirds of the total cases during 1984 occurred in Rajasthan (38%) and Madhya Pradesh (29%). Karnataka (13%), Andhra Pradesh (11%), Maharashtra (8%) and Gujarat (1%) accounted for the remaining cases. After implementation of National Guinea Worm Eradication Programme (GWEP) by the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, Government of India in 1983-84, the last case of GW disease was reported in 1996. Disease has been eradicated and India was declared as guinea worm disease free country by WHO in 2000. As global eradication of guinea worm disease has not been achieved, the States (previously endemic for GW disease) are continuing the routine surveillance for the disease till global eradication is achieved.
#Prevention - Dracunculiasis - 1F64
There is no drug to treat Guinea- worm disease and nor any vaccine to prevent infection. However prevention is possible through preventive strategies. It is through preventive strategies that the disease is on the verge of eradication globally. Prevention strategies include: Guinea worm case detection with the continuous surveillance. Preventing transmission from each worm by treatment, cleaning and bandaging regularly the affected skin-area until the worm is completely expelled from the body. Making drinking water safe: provision and maintenance of safe drinking water supply on priority in GW endemic villages. 
#Treatment - Dracunculiasis - 1F64
There is no drug to treat Guinea worm disease and nor any vaccine to prevent infection. Once part of the worm begins to come out of the wound, the rest of the worm can only be pulled out, a few centimeters each day by winding it around a piece of gauze or a small stick. This process usually takes several weeks. Local cleansing of the lesion and local application of antibiotics will prevent secondary infection. The worm can also be surgically removed by a doctor before an ulcer forms.
#Symptoms - Dracunculiasis - 1F64
People do not usually have symptoms until about one year after they become infected with parasite. Person may develop fever, swelling, and pain in the area from where worm/ worms come out. In 90% cases site is usually lower legs and feet. The adult female worm comes out of the skin as whitish filament; it can be very painful, slow, and disabling period (duration of emergence: 1 to 3 weeks). The pain may get worse if the wound develops a secondary bacterial infection.
