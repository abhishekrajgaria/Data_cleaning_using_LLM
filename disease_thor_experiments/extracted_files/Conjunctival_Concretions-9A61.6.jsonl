#Causes - Conjunctival Concretions - 9A61.6
Concretions are formed due to the accumulation of epithelial cells and inspissated mucous in depressions called Henle glands. The causes and risk factors for conjunctival concretions are variable but are associated most commonly with ageing and chronic inflammation of conjunctiva. Causes and risk factors are: Ageing process, Chronic conjunctival inflammation (e.g. trachoma), Tear film deficiency (present as decreased values of the Schirmerâ€™s test and tear film break-up time), Severe atopic keratoconjunctivitis, Meibomian gland dysfunction (e. g. chronic meibomitis), Re-crystallisation of certain eye drops (e.g. sulphadiazine).
#Diagnosis - Conjunctival Concretions - 9A61.6
Diagnosis of conjunctival concretions is often incidental. Patients are usually asymptomatic and conjunctival concretions are noted on ocular examination. Some patients with protruding concretions may complain of irritation and foreign body sensation in eye. Patients may or may not give history of chronic conjunctivitis. 
#Symptoms - Conjunctival Concretions - 9A61.6
Concretions are almost always asymptomatic because they usually remain hidden into the palpebral conjunctiva, not noticed by patients, until they become large and protrude through the palpebral tissues. Concretions may irritate eyes, but only if they erode the overlying conjunctival epithelium and come in contact with the cornea. Protruding concretions may cause symptoms such as: Foreign body sensation, Lacrimation (watering), Discomfort, Irritation, Redness, Corneal abrasion (less common).
#Overview - Conjunctival Concretions - 9A61.6
Conjunctival concretions (Conjunctival lithiasis) are small vascular, granular, yellowish-white deposits being produced due to conjunctival degeneration and are found in the sub-epithelium of palpebral conjunctiva and fornix (junction between palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva) in the elderly group or in patients with chronic inflammatory conditions. Deposits were found in patients as young as 20 years old, with the range of occurrence from 30-80 years old. Concretions appear as multiple tiny inclusion cysts containing yellowish-white deposits of inspissated mucous and degenerated epithelial debris including keratin. They are frequently discrete, but confluent concretions are not uncommon. In one study, no significant difference was found between the lacalisation on the upper and lower eyelids, right or left eye, and most of the concretions were superficial and hard, and mainly single. Associated dysfunction of meibomian glands was also noticed in some patients.
#Treatment - Conjunctival Concretions - 9A61.6
Management of conjunctival concretions: Non-symptomatic conjunctival concretions: Since concretions are located in sub-epithelial space and are asymptomatic, management is usually unnecessary and is not required. Symptomatic conjunctival concretions: If concretions erode through the epithelium and produce symptoms, they can often be removed with a small-gauge needle under topical surface anaesthesia at the slit lamp (bio-microscope), by an eye specialist.
