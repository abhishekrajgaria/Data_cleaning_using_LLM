#Causes - Neonatal Conjunctivitis - KA65.0
The main causes of neonatal conjunctivitis are: Chemical conjunctivitis: Neonatal conjunctivitis is commonly caused due to post-delivery use of ophthalmic silver nitrate given for the prophylaxis of ocular infection. Bacterial conjunctivitis: Bacteria causing neonatal conjunctivitis are: Chlamydia trachomatis (serotypes D-K). Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Staphylococcus aureus. Staphylococcus epidermidis. Streptococcus haemolyticus. Pneumococcus. Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Chlamydia trachomatis is the most common infectious cause of neonatal conjunctivitis. Gonococcus causes most serious of neonatal conjunctivitis.
#Complications - Neonatal Conjunctivitis - KA65.0
Ocular complications of neonatal conjunctivitis include: Pseudo-membrane formation. Thickened palpebral conjunctiva. Pannus formation. Corneal oedema. Corneal opacification. Corneal ulcer. Corneal perforation. Staphyloma. Endophthalmitis. Blindness. Systemic complications of neonatal conjunctivitis may be: Chlamydial conjunctivitis: Pneumonitis. Otitis. Paryngeal and rectal colonisation. Gonococcal conjunctivitis: Meningitis. Septicaemia. Arthritis. Anorectal infection. Herpes simplex conjunctivitis: Encephalitis.
#Diagnosis - Neonatal Conjunctivitis - KA65.0
Laboratory diagnosis: Laboratory tests for neonatal conjunctivitis includes following: Conjunctival scraping for Gram stain or Giemsa stain. Conjunctival scraping for polymerase chain reaction assay (PCR). Culture on chocolate agar and/or Thayer-Martin medium. Culture on blood agar. Culture of corneal epithelial cells, if involved.
#Overview - Neonatal Conjunctivitis - KA65.0
Neonatal conjunctivitis (Ophthalmia neonatorum) is defined as a conjunctival inflammation that occurs during first month of life after birth. Various causes have been implicated such as bacterial, viral including chemical conjunctivitis. Complications may be mild such as hyperaemia with scant conjunctival discharge to permanent scarring leading to even blindness.
#Prevention - Neonatal Conjunctivitis - KA65.0
Various agents used for prophylaxis (prevention) of neonatal conjunctivitis are: Topical prophylaxis: Silver nitrate drops: Silver nitrate drops may be used and is the best agent in areas where the incidence of penicillinase-producing Neisseria gonorrhoeae (PPNG) is significant. The incidence of chemical conjunctivitis has declined as the use of silver nitrate is abandoned in many countries in favour of topical medication such as erythromycin. Povidone-iodine solution. Tetracycline eye ointment. Erythromycin eye ointment. Erythromycin ointment is considered the best regimen for prophylaxis against neonatal conjunctivitis because of its effectiveness against gonococcal, and also against non-chlamydial and non-gonococcal pathogens and owing to its low incidence of causing chemical conjunctivitis. Systemic prophylaxis: Infants with possible infectious exposure in-utero or during birth should receive appropriate prophylaxis. Systemic ceftriaxone: Systemic ceftriaxone is given to neonates born to mothers with untreated or suspected gonococcal infection.
#Risk Factor - Neonatal Conjunctivitis - KA65.0
Risk factors for neonatal conjunctivitis are: Maternal infections carried in birth canal. Exposure of infant to infections. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected mothers. Ocular injury during delivery. Inadequate ocular prophylaxis immediately after birth. Premature babies. Poor antenatal care. Poor and unhygienic delivery conditions. Post- delivery exposure to infection.
#Symptoms - Neonatal Conjunctivitis - KA65.0
Symptoms of common causes of conjunctivitis are: Chemical conjunctivitis: Chemical conjunctivitis present with: Mild redness of eyes. Slight swelling of eyes. Chlamydial conjunctivitis: Redness of eyes. Swelling of eyelids. Purulent discharge. Gonococcal conjunctivitis: Red eyes. Swelling of eyelids. Profuse purulent discharge. Miscellaneous Non-chlamydial non-gonococcal conjunctivitis: Red eyes. Swelling of eyelids. Some purulent discharge. Herpes simplex conjunctivitis: Moderate redness of eyes. Swelling of eyelids.
#Treatment - Neonatal Conjunctivitis - KA65.0
Management should be carried out under medical supervision. Prior to birth, obtain cervical (lower part of uterus) culture if indicated, to exclude the risk of transmission of chlamydial, gonococcal, herpetic and other bacterial organisms to the foetus during vaginal delivery. Infection should be managed appropriately or the newborn may be delivered through Caesarean section. Preliminary management pending culture is based on clinical picture and findings on Gram stain, Giemsa stain and Papanicolaou smear. Since gonococcal conjunctivitis can infect an intact corneal epithelium and may progress rapidly leading to ulceration, prompt treatment is necessary. Infants with acute neonatal conjunctivitis should be treated for gonococcal conjunctivitis and is later modified based on the culture report. The treatment prior to laboratory result includes topical erythromycin and systemic cephalosporin.
