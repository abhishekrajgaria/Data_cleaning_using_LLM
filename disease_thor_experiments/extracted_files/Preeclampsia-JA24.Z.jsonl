#Causes - Preeclampsia - JA24.Z
The pathogenesis of preeclampsia is only partially understood and it is related to disturbances in placentation at the beginning of pregnancy, followed by generalized inflammation and progressive endothelial damage.
#Complications - Preeclampsia - JA24.Z
Pregnant women with preeclampsia may have following complications: Eclampsia, HELLP syndrome, Placental abruption, Stroke, Pulmonary oedema, kidney Failure, Liver Failure, Disseminated intravascular coagulation. Foetal complications: These are short and long-term effects: Intrauterine growth restriction, Preterm birth, Still birth, Long-term Effects.
#Overview - Preeclampsia - JA24.Z
Preeclampsia is one of the hypertensive (high blood pressure) disorders of pregnancy. It is a major cause of maternal and perinatal mortality (number of stillbirths and deaths of newborn in the first week of life) and morbidity. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy occur in about 10% of all pregnant women around the world. Preeclampsia affects 3â€“5% of pregnancies. Along with preeclampsia, other diseases which are included in the group of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are eclampsia, gestational hypertension and chronic hypertension. In Asia and Africa, nearly one tenth of all maternal deaths are associated with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. In India, the incidence of preeclampsia is reported to be 8-10% among the pregnant women. According to a study, the prevalence of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy was 7.8% with preeclampsia in 5.4% of the study population in India*. Preeclampsia is a pregnancy specific hypertensive disease with multisystem involvement. It is a disorder of widespread vascular endothelial malfunction and vasospasm that occurs after 20 weeks of gestation and can present as late as 4-6 weeks postpartum (after child birth). According to the new guidelines given by American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (ACOG) in 2013, the diagnosis of preeclampsia does not require the detection of high levels of protein in the urine (proteinuria) along with hypertension. Evidence shows that changes in kidney and liver can occur without signs of proteinuria, and the amount of protein in the urine does not predict how severely the disease will progress.
#Diagnosis - Preeclampsia - JA24.Z
Tests advised for evaluation of progress of preeclampsia are: Blood tests, Urine analysis, Ultrasonography, Nonstress test or biophysical profile.
#Risk factors - Preeclampsia - JA24.Z
Risk factors: Primigravida specially in adolescents and women over 35 years of age, Obesity, Having a family history of preeclampsia, blood pressure or preeclampsia in an earlier pregnancy, Chronic high blood pressure or kidney disease before pregnancy, Conditions leading to hyperplacentation and large placentas.
#Prevention - Preeclampsia - JA24.Z
Few recommendations provided by World Health Organization (WHO) and ACOG: Magnesium sulfate is recommended for the prevention of eclampsia in women with severe preeclampsia in preference to other anticonvulsants. Diuretics, particularly thiazides, are not recommended for the prevention of preeclampsia and its complications. Preeclampsia particularly associated with preterm delivery should be considered as a strong risk factor for cardiovascular disease in later life. Therefore these women should be advised to: Maintain ideal body weight, Engage in aerobic exercise regularly, Eat diet high in fiber and vegetables and fruits and low in fat, Avoid tobacco.
#Treatment - Preeclampsia - JA24.Z
Management of pregnant women with preeclampsia without severe features aims with first consideration of safety of women and her foetus and second with delivery of a mature newborn that will not require intensive or prolonged neonatal care. In pregnancy with severe preeclampsia, the parenteral (intravenous/intramuscular) administration of magnesium sulfate is recommended. In women with severe preeclampsia at term, early delivery is recommended. Antenatal corticosteroid: this administration should be considered in women with severe preeclampsia receiving expectant management at 34 weeks or less of gestation for foetal lung maturity. The mode of delivery: It should be determined by foetal gestational age, foetal presentation, cervical status, and maternal- foetal condition.
#Symptoms - Preeclampsia - JA24.Z
Symptoms of preeclampsia: Hypertension (High blood pressure); Proteinuria (Protein in urine); preeclampsia.Oedema; Sudden weight gain; Headache; Nausea or vomiting; Abdominal pain; Changes in vision; Difficulty in breathing, gasping, or panting; Hyperreflexia. Severe hypertension, hyperreflexia , headache (increasing frequency, unrelieved by regular analgesics) , clouding of vision , oliguria (passing less than 400ml urine in 24 hours) , upper abdominal pain (epigastric pain or pain in right upper quadrant) , pulmonary oedema (difficulty in breathing) are the signs of severe preeclampsia.
