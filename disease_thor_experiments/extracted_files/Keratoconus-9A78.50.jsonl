#Causes - Keratoconus - 9A78.50
Studies suggest various contributory factors such as: Enzyme abnormalities in corneal epithelium: Enzyme abnormalities such as increased expression of lysosomal enzymes (catalase and cathepsin) and decreased levels of inhibitors of proteolytic enzymes (tissue inhibitor matrix metalloproteinases), may play a role in corneal stromal degradation. Differentially expressed corneal epithelium: Differentially expressed corneal epithelium between keratoconus and myopes (as controls) in both genetic expression and protein expression. Molecular defect: Molecular defect producing unusual absence of water channel protein aquaporin 5 in keratoconus as compared to normal corneal epithelium. Gelatinolytic activity: Gelatinolytic activity in stroma has been described, which may be due to decreased function of enzyme inhibitors. Abnormalities in corneal collagen and its cross-linking: Abnormalities in corneal collagen and its cross-linking may be the cause of keratoconus. Eye rubbing: Cytokine has been suggested as a mediator of eye rubbing and stromal degradation. Keratoconus in patients with atopic dermatitis, Down syndrome, and Leber congenital amaurosis, a congenital photoreceptor degeneration, could be related to forceful eye rubbing or the oculodigital reflex. The latter is a behavioural pattern seen in visually and mentally handicapped children who repeatedly strike their eyes with hands. Hard contact lens wear.
#Complications - Keratoconus - 9A78.50
Complications of keratoconus may be: Acute corneal hydrops: Advanced keratoconus rarely may progress to acute corneal hydrops due to breaks in Descemet’s membrane, leading to corneal oedema. Secondary corneal scarring.
#Diagnosis - Keratoconus - 9A78.50
Refraction, keratometry, corneal topography and slit- lamp (bio-microscopy) examination helps in reaching to the diagnosis of keratoconus. Refraction: Patients with keratoconus often report blurring/impairment of vision due to progressive myopia and irregular astigmatism. There may be multiple unsatisfactory attempts in obtaining optimum correction with glasses. Spectacles and soft contact lenses may initially give satisfactory vision, but vision tends to decline over time and requires rigid gas-permeable contact lenses for correction. Keratometry: Images of keratometry mires commonly will be steep, highly astigmatic, irregular, and often appear egg-shaped rather than circular or oval in keratoconus. A value of 47.2 Diopters (D) or greater is suggestive of keratoconus. These signs may be absent in some patients of keratoconus. Corneal topography/Computerised videokeratography: is helpful in reaching a diagnosis, especially when the typical bio-microscopy signs of Vogt striae and Fleischer ring are absent. Several quantitative indices are available using corneal topography information to screen for keratoconus. Ultrasonic pachymetry: Ultrasonic pachymetry may be useful to confirm corneal thinning in patients with suspected keratoconus on slit- lamp examination or videokeratography. Orbscan corneal topography system and Oculus Pentacam which provides both topography and pachymetry maps are particularly useful in making a diagnosis.
#Overview - Keratoconus - 9A78.50
Keratoconus is a non-inflammatory, bilateral (but usually asymmetrical) disease of the cornea which results in progressive corneal steepening. It is characterised by para-central corneal thinning and ectasia so that the cornea takes the shape of a cone. Visual loss occurs primarily from myopia and irregular astigmatism and secondarily from corneal scarring.
#Symptoms - Keratoconus - 9A78.50
Symptoms are highly variable and depend upon the stage of the disease. Early in the disease, there may be no symptoms. In advanced disease, there is significant diminution and distortion of vision. Monocular polyopia (perception of multiple ‘ghost’ images in the eye). Blurring of vision. Decreased visual acuity. Progressively poor vision, not corrected with eye glasses. Impaired visual perception. Decreased contrast sensitivity. Streaking and flaring distortion around light sources. Marked anisometropia (difference in vision of two eyes). Glare. Photophobia (increased sensitivity to light). Eyestrain, in order to read clearly. Poor vision at night. Itching. Monocular polyopia (perception of multiple ‘ghost’ images in the eye), decreased visual acuity, and decreased contrast sensitivity may be seen in other disorders, especially early nuclear sclerotic cataract.
#Prevention - Keratoconus - 9A78.50
To prevent keratoconus, patients should avoid rubbing of eyes.
#Treatment - Keratoconus - 9A78.50
Management should be carried out under medical supervision. Medical therapy: Spectacle correction: Initially, attempt should be made to correct myopic astigmatism by prescribing spectacle correction. Early keratoconus patients may get satisfactory vision with spectacles. Development of irregular astigmatism often limits the use of spectacle correction, and patients may require contact lenses. Rigid gas- permeable (RGP) contact lenses: Rigid gas- permeable (RGP) contact lenses are often the first lenses of choice and may be prescribed once spectacle-corrected acuity becomes inadequate. Other lenses used are piggyback lenses, pure hydro gel lenses, multi curve or aspheric contact lenses. Contact lens wear often is complicated by episodes of intolerance, allergic reactions (e.g. giant papillary conjunctivitis), corneal abrasions, neovascularisation, sometimes leading to total intolerance. Though contact lenses are extremely useful, it may increase the risk of corneal scarring. Surgical therapy: Surgical therapy may be resorted to when patient does not improve with the use of contact lenses. Contact lenses may fail due to: Inadequate acuity. Inadequate lens tolerance. Frequent lens displacements. Peripheral thinning.
