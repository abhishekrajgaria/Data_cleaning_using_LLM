#Causes - Tuberculosis - 1B1Z
The main cause of TB is Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a small, aerobics, non motile bacillus. TB spread when a person with an active TB infection in their lungs coughs or sneezes and someone else inhales the expelled droplets containing TB bacteria.
#Overview - Tuberculosis - 1B1Z
Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Tuberculosis commonly affects   the lungs, but can also affect other parts of the body. It  spreads from person to person through the air, when people who are infected with TB infection cough, sneeze or otherwise transmit respiratory fluids through the air. About one-quarter of the world’s population is estimated to be infected by TB bacteria but out of these only 5-15% of people will fall ill with active TB disease. The rest have TB infection with no illness and cannot transmit the disease. According to WHO, an estimated 9.9 million people fell ill with TB and 1.5 million people died globally in 2020, despite being a preventable and curable disease.
#Prevention - Tuberculosis - 1B1Z
With the objective to prevent emergence of TB in susceptible population various measures are indicated: a) Air borne infection control measures- TB infection control is a combination of measures aimed at minimizing the risk of TB transmission in community, hospitals and other settings. Various infection control measures are: Early diagnosis and proper management of TB patients, Houses should be adequately ventilated. B) Contact tracing- Since transmission can occur from index case to the contact any time (before diagnosis or during treatment) all contacts of TB patients must be evaluated. These groups include: All close contacts, especially household contacts. C) Isoniazid preventive therapy- Preventive therapy is recommended to Children < 6 years of age, who are close contacts of a TB patient. These children should be evaluated for active TB by a medical officer/ pediatrician and after excluding active TB he/she should be given INH preventive therapy.
#Risk factors - Tuberculosis - 1B1Z
The most common risk factor associated with TB is HIV and other conditions that impair the immune system. Other factors include: Tobacco use, Malnutrition, Alcoholism.
#Symptoms - Tuberculosis - 1B1Z
Tuberculosis most commonly affects the lungs. Common symptoms of active lung TB   are: A persistent cough of more than two weeks that brings up phlegm and blood at times, Breathlessness, which is usually mild to begin with and gradually gets worse, Lack of appetite and weight loss, A high temperature of 38ºC (100.4ºF) or above, Extreme tiredness or fatigue, Night sweats, Chest pains. Less commonly TB infection  can occure in other organs of the body, as  : Lymph nodes  , bones and joints, digestive system, nervous system, bladder and reproductive system. This is known as extra pulmonary TB. Symptoms of extra pulmonary TB vary according to organ/system affected. Extra pulmonary TB is more common in people with a weakened immune system, such as those with HIV.
#Diagnosis - Tuberculosis - 1B1Z
Symptomatic Diagnosis: Coughing for more than 2 weeks, loss of weight, loss of appetite, fever and night sweats, fatigue are common symptoms of tuberculosis. If someone has these symptoms, one should seek medical advice to check whether it is tuberculosis. Blood tests. Sputum examination: Samples of mucous and phlegm are checked for the presence of bacteria. Chest X-ray: This uses radiation to create an image of lungs. In TB infection, there are changes in the structure of lungs, which of lungs, are visible on the X-ray. Drug susceptibility testing: It provides a definitive diagnosis of drug- resistant TB. CBNAAT (Cartridges Based Nucleic Acid Amplification Test): CBNAAT is used for early diagnosis of MDR-TB and TB in high risk population such as presumptive TB cases in PLHIV (people living with HIV), EP-TB (extra-pulmonary TB) and pediatric populations.  The CB NAAT machines have been placed at most of the districts in the country at headquarter or Medical College, ART Center or major Pediatric hospitals.
#Treatment - Tuberculosis - 1B1Z
Initiation of appropriate anti-TB treatment wherever patients seek care (public or private health services) and sustaining all TB patients on complete treatment with patient friendly system and social support are important measures under RNTCP. For new TB cases, the treatment in intensive phase (IP) consists of four drugs FDCs- Isoniazid (INH), Rifampicin, Pyrazinamide and Ethambutol (HRZE) in daily doses (as per four weight band categories) for eight weeks and in continuation phase three drugs FDCs with Rifampicin, Isoniazid, and Ethambutol (HRE) are continued for 16 weeks. For previously treated cases of TB, the intensive phase is of 12 weeks, where injection streptomycin is given for eight weeks along with four drugs FDCs (INH, Rifampicin, Pyrazinamide and Ethambutol) in daily doses (as per weight bands) and after eight weeks streptomycin is stopped, the four drugs FDCs (INH, Rifampicin, Pyrazinamide and Ethambutol) are continued for another four weeks. In continuation phase FDCs containing Rifampicin, INH, and Ethambutol are given for another 20 weeks as daily doses.
