#Causes - Otitis Media - AB0Z
Otitis media (middle ear infection) is caused when a bacterial or viral infection, such as a cold, spreads into a part of the ear known as the Eustachian tube. Enlarged tonsils or adenoids (small lumps of tissue at the back of the throat, above the tonsils) may block the Eustachian tube. Adenoids and tonsils can be removed if they cause a persistent or frequently reoccurring ear infection, this is more common in children than in adults.
#Complications - Otitis Media - AB0Z
Most commonly reported complications are detailed below: Mastoiditis, Cholesteatoma, Labyrinthitis, Meningitis, Brain abscess.
#Diagnosis - Otitis Media - AB0Z
Tests to be conducted are described below: Tympanometry: It helps to measures, how the ear drum reacts to changes in air pressure. A healthy ear drum should move easily if there is a change in air pressure. Tympanocentesis: It involves draining fluid out of the middle ear using a small needle. The fluid can then be tested for bacteria or viruses that could be responsible for the infection. CT scans: A computer tomography (CT) scan may be used if it is thought the infection may have spread out of the middle ear.
#Overview - Otitis Media - AB0Z
It is a middle ear infection. Sometimes ear infections can be painful and may even need antibiotics. It is very common in childhood. Most ear infections occur in infants between the age of 6-18 months, though anyone can get an ear infection. For reasons that are unclear they are more common in boys than girls.
#Treatment - Otitis Media - AB0Z
Antibiotics: The first line antibiotic treatment is amoxicillin . Among short-course antibiotics, long-acting azithromycin is found more likely to be successful than short-acting alternatives . If there is no improvement after 2–3 days of treatment a change in therapy may be considered. Tympanostomy tube: In chronic cases with effusions, insertion of tympanostomy tube (also called a "grommet") into the eardrum reduces recurrence rates in the 6 months after placement. Thus tubes are recommended in those who have more than 3 episodes of acute otitis media in 6 month or 4 in a year associated with an effusion.
#Symptoms - Otitis Media - AB0Z
Main symptoms of otitis media include: Earache, A high temperature (fever) of 38°C (100.4°F) or higher, Lack of energy, Slight deafness, Often accompanied with nasal discharge and cough.
