#Causes - Congenital Capillary Haemangioma - 2E81.2Y
Congenital capillary haemangioma, one of the common orbital tumour in children, represents a vascular hamartoma derived from endothelial rests. About one-third of lesions are seen at birth and the remaining lesions are apparent by six months of age.
#Complication - Congenital Capillary Haemangioma - 2E81.2Y
The most significant ocular complication is amblyopia, which may result due to occlusion of the visual axis or from anisometropia due to pressure induced astigmatism.
#Overview - Congenital Capillary Haemangioma - 2E81.2Y
Congenital Capillary haemangioma of eyelid (strawberry naevus) is a common vascular hamartoma in infants/children and is derived from endothelial rests. Periorbital haemangioma may present as: Superficial cutaneous lesion (strawberry haemangioma), Subcutaneous lesion, Deep orbital tumour, A combination of above mentioned locations.
#Diagnosis - Congenital Capillary Haemangioma - 2E81.2Y
Clinically, superficial congenital capillary haemangiomas initially present as a red flat lesion with telangiectatic blood vessels. When enlarged, they become elevated, red, dome shaped mass having soft consistency. The masses are compressible and blanch with pressure. Histopathology: Congenital capillary haemangiomas are composed of thin walled capillaries. This is lobulated and is separated by septa. The masses are well circumscribed by fibrous tissue. The capillaries may be lined by flattened endothelium and contain erythrocytes. Investigations: Following investigations may aid in diagnosis: Computed tomography, Magnetic resonance imaging, Ultrasound.
#Symptoms - Congenital Capillary Haemangioma - 2E81.2Y
Congenital capillary haemangioma may present as: Flat red coloured lesion with telangiectatic blood vessels, Enlarged lesions become elevated, red, dome shaped mass with soft consistency, Subcutaneous lesions present as a bluish-purple mass, Involuted haemangiomas are pale pink in colour or have white mottled appearance due to fibrosis.
#Treatment - Congenital Capillary Haemangioma - 2E81.2Y
Conservative management: Most congenital capillary haemangiomas undergo spontaneous regression. Therefore, conservative observation is appropriate. Medical therapy: Corticosteroids: Systemic or intralesional corticosteroids produce dramatic reduction in size of the lesion. This treatment may require repetition. This should be given under medical supervision. Laser treatment: This may be required in select cases. Radiotherapy: Radiotherapy may be tried, but it carries the risk of secondary orbital tumours. Surgical therapy: This may be advocated in select localised lesions.
