#Causes - Lagophthalmos - 9A03.4Z
Lagophthalmos is produced due to following three main causes: Failure of function of the orbicularis oculi muscle: This is the most common cause. It may be paralytic, because of facial intracranial nerve involving the orbicularis oculi muscle, or spastic, as is seen in thyrotoxicosis. Excessive protrusion of the globe in the orbit: Lagophthalmos may accompany proptosis or buphthalmos (enlarged cornea due to elevated intraocular pressure in small children), in spite of normal eyelids, which fail to cover the proptosed eye. Inadequate vertical dimension of either upper or lower eyelid: It may be structural when retraction or shortening of the eyelids results from scarring or atrophy following injury (e.g. burns) or a disease. 
#Complications - Lagophthalmos - 9A03.4Z
Incomplete closure results in: Increased evaporation of tears, Poor tear film distribution, Disruption of mucin layer component of tear film, Drying of cornea, Breakdown of ocular surface.
#Diagnosis - Lagophthalmos - 9A03.4Z
Diagnosis of lagophthalmos is primarily clinical. Slit lamp examination by an eye specialist may show inter-palpebral punctate epithelial keratopathy, which is diagnostic of lagophthalmos or incomplete blink. Distribution of the punctate epithelial keratopathy depends upon the position of cornea during sleep in patients with nocturnal lagophthalmos. External examination for complete eyelid closure should be done with patient gently closing the eyes.
#Overview - Lagophthalmos - 9A03.4Z
Lagophthalmos is the inability to close the eyelids completely on attempted closure. The term lagophthalmos is derived from the Greek word ‘lagos’ which means ‘hare’, since the hare was believed to sleep with its eyes open. Closure of eyelids is primarily a function of the descending upper eyelid. The lower eyelid exhibits very little upward movement during closure of eyes. Because of this, many patients tolerate lower eyelid retraction with minimal or no symptoms, as long as the upper eyelid retains normal movement.
#Symptoms - Lagophthalmos - 9A03.4Z
Patients present with symptoms such as: Foreign body sensation, Irritation, Burning of eyes, Watering, Eye infection, Corneal ulceration, Dry eyes.
#Treatment - Lagophthalmos - 9A03.4Z
Management should be carried out under medical supervision. General therapy: Ocular surface lubrication: Initial symptomatic management is directed towards ocular surface lubrication. Viscous artificial tears are used. Prevent evaporative drying: Prefabricated moisture chamber or thin polyethylene film may be applied over the eyes to reduce evaporative drying. Definitive therapy: Proptosis, Lid shortening, Inadequate vertical skin, Symblepharon, Paralysis of orbicularis oculi muscle, Lower lid retraction.
