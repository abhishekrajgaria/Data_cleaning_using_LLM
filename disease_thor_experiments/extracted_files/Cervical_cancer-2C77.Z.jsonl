#Diagnosis - Cervical cancer - 2C77.Z
Most of the cervical cancer and HPV infections in the early stages show no clinical signs and symptoms; precancerous lesions and early cancers can be detected by screening tests. Screening for cervical cancer-There are 3 different types of screening tests: Conventional (Pap) test and liquid-based cytology (LBC) - The Pap test is used to detect abnormal cells that may develop into cancer if left untreated. In a conventional Pap test, the specimen (or smear) is placed on a glass microscope slide and a fixative is added. In an automated liquid-based Pap cytology test, cervical cells collected with a brush or other instrument are placed in a vial of liquid preservative. One advantage of liquid-based testing is that the same cell sample can also be tested for the presence of high-risk types of HPV, a process known as “Pap and HPV co-testing. Visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) - Doctor may apply a dilute acetic acid solution (vinegar solution) to the cervix, which causes abnormal areas to turn white. Further a biopsy can be taken from abnormal area. HPV testing for high-risk HPV type- HPV testing is used to look for the presence of high-risk HPV types in cervical cells. Diagnostic tests for detection of cervical pre-cancer: some times, a diagnostic test is used for definitive diagnosis or confirmation of pre-cancer or cancer subsequent to positive screening results. Colposcopy, biopsy and endocervical curettage (ECC) are the commonly used diagnostic tests for cervical pre-cancer. Colposcopy is the examination of the cervix, vagina and vulva with an instrument called colposcope. It is used in patients with positive screening results. Biopsy is the removal of small sample of abnormal tissue for microscopic examination. Biopsies can be taken from areas of the cervix that are VIA-positive or from areas that appear suspicious for cancer. Endocervical curettage (ECC) is a simple procedure in which some surface cells are gently scraped from the endocervical canal with a special thin instrument or spatula and examined under microscope. An endocervical cytobrush specimen may also be used for examination.
#Overview - Cervical cancer - 2C77.Z
Cervical cancer. Cancer is the uncontrolled growth of body cells and can start almost anywhere in the human body. When cancer develops in the cervix of female it is termed as cervical cancer or cancer cervix. Cervix is the lower part of the uterus and connects the body of the uterus to the vagina (birth canal).The lower part of the cervix (ectocervix) lies within the vagina and the upper two thirds of the cervix (endocervix) lies above the vagina. Most cervical cancers originate in the area where the endocervix and ectocervix join. Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women worldwide and second most common cancer in women living in less developed regions. World Health Organization (WHO) estimated 530 000 new cases of cervical cancer globally (estimations for 2012), with approximately 270 000 deaths (representing 7.5% of all female cancer deaths). More than 85% of these deaths occurred in low- and middle-income countries.
#Prevention - Cervical cancer - 2C77.Z
Cervical cancer prevention and control: A comprehensive approach- WHO recommends a comprehensive approach to cervical cancer prevention and control that includes three interdependent components: primary, secondary and tertiary prevention. Primary prevention: reduce the risk of HPV infection It begins with HPV vaccination of girls aged 9-13 years, before they become sexually active. Two HPV vaccines are there - a bivalent and a quadrivalent vaccine.The quadrivalent vaccine gives 100% protection against infection from HPV types 16 and 18, which are responsible for around 70% of all cervical cancers. It also protects against HPV types 6 and 11 that cause genital warts. Secondary prevention: screening for and treating pre-cancer Early detection, by screening all women in the target age group (30-49 years) followed by treatment of detected precancerous lesions can prevent the majority of cervical cancers. Cervical cancer screening should be an essential part of a woman’s routine health care. It detects pre-cancer and cancer among women who have no symptoms and may feel perfectly healthy. Important aspect of screening is that both precancerous lesions and early cervical cancers can be treated very successfully at this stage. Tertiary prevention: treatment of invasive cervical cancer The goal of tertiary prevention is to decrease the number of deaths due to cervical cancer. Women suspected of having invasive cervical cancer should be referred to facilities that offer cancer diagnosis and treatment. Appropriate treatment in early stage of cancer can result in cure. In advanced stage of cancer treatment and palliative care can improve quality of life, control symptoms and minimize pain suffering.
#Symptoms - Cervical cancer - 2C77.Z
Women with early cervical cancers and pre-cancers usually have no symptom. Symptoms of cervical cancer appear only after the cancer has reached an advanced stage. Symptoms may be: irregular, intermenstrual (between periods) or abnormal vaginal bleeding after sexual intercourse or  bleeding after menopause; bleeding after douching, or after a pelvic exam; vaginal discomfort or odorous discharge from vagina, the discharge may contain some blood and may occur between periods or after menopause; pain during sex; back, leg or pelvic pain; fatigue, weight loss, loss of appetite; a single swollen leg. These signs and symptoms are not specific, may be present in other conditions also, but still it is advised to consult health care professional at earliest. More severe symptoms may develop at advanced stages of cervical cancer.
#Treatment - Cervical cancer - 2C77.Z
If abnormal cells or lesions detected during screening tests, treatment is needed to excise them. It includes cryotherapy (destroying abnormal tissue on the cervix by freezing it) or Loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) when the patient is not eligible for cryotherapy. When cancer is diagnosed, the treatment frequently requires a multidisciplinary approach with the involvement of a gynecologic oncologist, radiation oncologist, and medical oncologist. The treatment of cervical cancer varies with the stage of the disease. For early invasive cancer, surgery is advised. In more advanced cases, radiation combined with chemotherapy and in patients with disseminated disease, chemotherapy or radiation provides palliative management of symptoms. Palliative care is given to help people with advanced disease to have dignity and peace during difficult and final phases of life.
#Risk Factor - Cervical cancer - 2C77.Z
There are several risk factors which increase the chances of developing cervical cancer. The most important risk factor for cervical cancer is infection by the human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV is mainly transmitted through sexual contact and most people are infected with HPV shortly after the onset of sexual activity. Skin-to-skin genital contact can transmit the infection; penetrative sex is not required for transmission. HPV infections usually clear up without any intervention within a few months after acquiring the infection, and about 90% clear within 2 years. A small proportion of infections with certain types of HPV can persist and progress to cancer. The time period between the oncogenic (cancer causing) HPV infection and occurrence of the invasive cervical cancer is 15–20 years. Risk factors that may lead HPV infection to persist and progress to cancer: Early first sexual intercourse. Multiple sexual partners. High parity. Long-term use of hormonal contraceptives. Tobacco use. Immune suppression (for example, HIV-infected individuals are at higher risk of HPV infection and are infected by a broader range of HPV types). Low socioeconomic status, poor hygiene and diet low in antioxidants. Co-infection with Chlamydia trachomatis and Herpes simplex virus type-2
