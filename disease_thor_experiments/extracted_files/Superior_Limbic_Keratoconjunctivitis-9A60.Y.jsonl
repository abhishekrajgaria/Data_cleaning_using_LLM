#Diagnosis - Superior Limbic Keratoconjunctivitis - 9A60.Y
A diagnosis of SLK should only be made after a thorough patient history is obtained and physical examination is performed, since diagnosis is based primarily on the clinical findings. Clinical examination: It requires slit-lamp (bio-microscopy) examination by an eye-specialist. Conjunctiva/Limbus: It is advisable in suspected SLK patient to simultaneously elevate both upper lids and look at the superior conjunctiva. Diagnostic procedures: Test for redundancy of the superior bulbar conjunctiva, Impression cytology, Confocal microscopy.
#Causes - Superior Limbic Keratoconjunctivitis - 9A60.Y
Soft contact lens wear may be associated with features like SLK.  It may be attributable to preservatives especially thiomersal. Removal of lens or preservatives is usually curative. There have been many theories about the aetiology of SLK, but still some uncertainty remains till date. Possible aetiological theories: Mechanical trauma, Biochemical abnormalities, Viral aetiology, Bacterial aetiology, Autoimmune aetiology.
#Overview - Superior Limbic Keratoconjunctivitis - 9A60.Y
Superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis (SLK) is relatively an uncommon chronic disease of superior limbus/cornea, and superior bulbar and tarsal conjunctiva. It affects one or both eyes of middle-aged people, about half the patients have abnormal thyroid function (usually hyperthyroidism). Superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis is believed to be due to blink-related trauma between the upper lid and the superior bulbar conjunctiva, precipitated in many cases by tear film insufficiency, and an excess of lax conjunctival tissue.
#Treatment - Superior Limbic Keratoconjunctivitis - 9A60.Y
Medical therapy: Artificial tears, Acetylcysteine, Rebamipide, Autologous serum tears, Topical corticosteroids, Topical cyclosporine A, Retinoic acid, Topical mast cell stabilisers, Topical ketotifen fumarate, Topical vitamin A, Supra-tarsal triamcinolone injection, Large-diameter contact lenses. Surgical therapy: Hallmark of SLK is redundancy of the superior bulbar conjunctiva. Different methods have been employed to attempt to tighten the redundant superior bulbar conjunctiva. Prognosis: In general, prognosis for superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis is excellent. 
#Symptoms - Superior Limbic Keratoconjunctivitis - 9A60.Y
The characteristic feature of the symptoms of SLK is its variability with intermittent remissions and exacerbations. Patients may have ocular (eye) symptoms such as: Burning sensation. Redness. Irritation (may be more prominent when patient looks upward). Foreign body sensation. Pain. Itching. Dry eye sensation. Mild photophobia. Frequent blinking. Blepharospasm. Mucoid discharge (less common). Diminution of vision (rare).
