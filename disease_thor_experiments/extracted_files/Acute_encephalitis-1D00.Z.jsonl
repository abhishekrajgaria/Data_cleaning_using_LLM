#Causes - Acute encephalitis syndrome - 1D00.Z
Acute Encephalitis Syndrome (AES) has a very complex etiology. Causative agents of AES include a wide variety of viruses, bacteria, protozoa, fungi, and non- infectious agents. While Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a leading cause of acute encephalitis syndrome in India (ranging from 5-35%), the etiology in a large number of cases however remains unidentified. In India during 2018, 15% of cases of AES were found positive for infection due to JEV. Herpes simplex virus, Influenza A virus, West Nile virus, Chandipura virus, mumps, measles, dengue, Parvovirus B4, enteroviruses and scrub typhus, S.pneumoniae are the other causes of AES in sporadic and outbreak cases in India. In many cases, however, no etiological agent is determined. Tick-borne encephalitis virus – TBEV, Zika virus, Nipah virus are also found positive in AES cases. Some are the zoonotic disease, that transmitted from animals to humans via mosquitoes (e.g. Japanese encephalitis virus, and West Nile virus) or ticks, (Tick-borne encephalitis virus), while for other flaviviruses humans are the natural hosts; these include dengue virus (DENV), and Zika virus (ZIKV).
#Complications - Acute encephalitis syndrome - 1D00.Z
The disease affects the central nervous system and can cause severe complications, seizures and even death. The Case Fatality Rate (CFR) of this disease is very high and those who survive may suffer from various degrees of neurological sequeale. (An estimated 25% of the affected children die, and among those who survive, about 30- 40% suffers from physical & mental impairment).
#Overview - Acute encephalitis syndrome - 1D00.Z
Acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) is a serious public health problem in India. It is characterized as acute-onset of fever and a change in mental status (mental confusion, disorientation, delirium, or coma) and/or new-onset of seizures in a person of any age at any time of the year. The disease most commonly affects children and young adults and can lead to considerable morbidity and mortality. Viruses are the main causative agents in AES cases, although other sources such as bacteria, fungus, parasites, spirochetes, chemicals, toxins and noninfectious agents have also been reported over the past few decades. Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is the major cause of AES in India (ranging from 5%-35%).Herpes simplex virus, Influenza A virus, West Nile virus, Chandipura virus, mumps, measles, dengue, Parvovirus B4, enteroviruses, Epstein-Barr virus and scrub typhus, S.pneumoniae are the other causes of AES in sporadic and outbreak form in India. Nipah virus, Zika virus are also found as causative agents for AES. The etiology in a large number of AES cases still remains unidentified.
#Diagnosis - Acute encephalitis syndrome - 1D00.Z
The National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme in India has set up country wide surveillance for AES through sentinel sites with a focus on detecting Japanese encephalitis (JEV). In the sentinel surveillance network, AES/JE is diagnosed by lgM Capture ELISA, and virus isolation is done in National Reference Laboratory. Laboratory-Confirmed case is a suspected case with any one of the following markers: Presence of lgM antibody in serum and/ or CSF to a specific virus including JE/Entero Virus or others, Four-fold difference in lgG antibody titre in paired sera, Virus isolation from brain tissue, Antigen detection by immunofluroscence, Nucleic acid detection by PCR
#Prevention - Acute encephalitis syndrome - 1D00.Z
National Programme for Prevention and Control of Japanese Encephalitis(JE)/ Acute Encephalitis Syndrome (NPPCJA): Considering the complexity of AES problem and to reduce morbidity, mortality and disability in children due to JE/AES, Government of India has developed a multi-pronged strategy with convergence of the concerned Ministries Ministry of Health and Family Welfare: Strengthening and expanding JE vaccination. Strengthening of public health activities. Better clinical management of JE/AES Cases. Physical medicine and rehabilitation (PMR). Establishing of district counselling centres. Monitoring, supervision and coordination. Research-cum-intervention project
#Symptoms - Acute encephalitis syndrome - 1D00.Z
Acute Encephalitis Syndrome (AES) is a general description of the clinical presentation of a disease characterized by high fever altered consciousness mostly in children below 15 years of age. Clinically, a case of AES is defined as a person of any age, at any time of year with the acute onset of fever and a change in mental status (including symptoms such as confusion, disorientation, coma, or inability to talk) AND/OR new onset of seizures (excluding simple febrile seizures). Other early clinical findings may include an increase in irritability, somnolence or abnormal behavior greater than that seen with usual febrile illness.
#Treatment - Acute encephalitis syndrome - 1D00.Z
Management of AES is essentially symptomatic. First line of management should be started at grass root level. To reduce severe morbidity and mortality it is important to identify early warning signs and refer patient to higher health facility. Danger Signs- Fever with any one of the following: Lethargy/ Unconsciousness/ Convulsions. Pre referral care- Sponging with tap water if fever is present Nothing to be given orally, Management of airway and breathing- Clear Airways, Patient’s position – Turn the patient on the side to reduce risk of aspiration. Keep the neck slightly extended and stabilize by placing cheek on one hand. Bend one leg to stabilize the body position. Referral to nearest first referral health facility.
