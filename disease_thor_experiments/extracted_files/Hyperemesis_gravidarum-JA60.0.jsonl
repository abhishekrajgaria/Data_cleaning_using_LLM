These include- Avoidance of stimuli that provoke nausea and vomiting such as strong odors, heat and noises that trigger the labyrinthine areas. Dietary counseling about frequent small meals and avoidance of spicy or fatty foods. Use of Ginger (ginger tea made from fresh grated ginger, ginger capsules, and ginger candies). Try bland foods, (such as the BRATT diet -bananas, rice, apple sauce, toast, and tea). Drink fluids often. Take a multivitamin that does not contain iron or take folic acid alone in first trimester. Eat light food in morning something like dry toast or a plain biscuit before getting up to avoid moving around on an empty stomach. Pharmacologic therapies- If diet and lifestyle changes do not help to reduce symptoms, or if there is severe nausea and vomiting of pregnancy, medical treatment may be needed. When other medical conditions are ruled out, certain medications can be given by medical expert to treat nausea and vomiting of pregnancy: Vitamin B6 and doxylamine, both drugs taken alone or together have been found to be safe to take during pregnancy and have no harmful effects on the baby. Antiemetic drugs (drugs preventing vomiting): If vitamin B6 and doxylamine combination is not effective, antiemetic drugs may be prescribed by doctor considering the severity of symptoms and safety of drug to use during pregnancy. Women who cannot tolerate oral liquids for a prolonged period or who have clinical signs of dehydration should receive intravenous hydration including dextrose and vitamins. Thiamine should be given before dextrose infusion to prevent Wernicke encephalopathy.

#Causes - Hyperemesis gravidarum - JA60.0
The exact cause of nausea and vomiting during pregnancy is not known. However, it is believed that rapidly rising blood level of human chorionic gonadotropin hormone released by the placenta during pregnancy may cause morning sickness. Women who have previously suffered from nausea and vomiting in pregnancy are more likely to have symptoms in a subsequent pregnancy. Mild morning sickness is common. Hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) is less common but more severe. HG can occur in any pregnancy but conditions with increased placental mass such as molar pregnancy and multiple gestations (twins or more babies) are associated with a higher risk for hyperemesis gravidarum.
