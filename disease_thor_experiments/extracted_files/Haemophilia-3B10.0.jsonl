#Complications - Haemophilia - 3B10.0
Joint damage: Joint damage can sometimes develop if hemophilia is poorly controlled. Successive joint bleeds can damage cartilage (the soft spongy tissue in joints that acts as a shock absorber) as well as the synovium (a thin layer of tissue that lines the inside of the joint). The more damaged a joint is, the more vulnerable it is to internal bleeding. This in turn means the joint will become even more damaged and vulnerable to bleeding. Joint damage is more common in older adults with severe hemophilia.
#Causes - Haemophilia - 3B10.0
Genetics: The genes are responsible for clotting factors VIII and IX are on the (X) chromosome. Females have two X chromosomes (XX) and males have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome (XY). If a female inherits an X chromosome with ‘haemophilia’ clotting factor genes, the other X chromosome will usually be normal, so they are still able to produce safe levels of clotting factors. Although some female ‘carriers’ of the ‘haemophilia’ X chromosome do have occasional clotting problems, they are rarely as serious as the problems in males. If a male inherits a ‘haemophilia’ X chromosome and they will not be able to produce normal levels of the clotting factors they need. Most males who inherit the ‘haemophilia’ X chromosome will have clotting problems some will be extremely severe.
#Overview - Haemophilia - 3B10.0
Hemophilia is an inherited condition that affects the blood’s ability to clot. Hemophilia A (clotting factor VIII deficiency) is the most common form of the disorder, present in about 1 in 5,000–10,000 births. Hemophilia B (factor IX deficiency) occurs in around 1 in about 20,000–34,000 births. Hemophilia is more likely to occur in males than females. The factors which clot (solidify) the blood is low in patients of Hemophilia. Thus when a blood vessel is injured, a temporary scab does form, but the missing coagulation factors prevent fibrin formation, which is necessary to maintain the blood clot.
#Diagnosis - Haemophilia - 3B10.0
Several options are available to diagnose hemophilia before, during and after birth if there is a family history of the condition. Tests before pregnancy: Genetic testing and counseling. Tests during pregnancy: Chorionic villus sampling (CVS) It is a procedure in which a small sample of placenta is removed from the womb and tested for the haemophilia gene, usually during weeks 10 to 13 of pregnancy. Amniocentesis: In this amniotic fluid is taken for testing, usually during weeks 15 to 20 or pregnancy. Tests after birth: If a child is suspected with hemophilia, a blood test can usually confirm the diagnosis. The blood test will also be able to identify whether child has hemophilia A or B.
#Treatment - Haemophilia - 3B10.0
As such there is no cure for haemophilia, it can be managed with regular infusions of the deficient clotting factor, i.e. factor VIII in hemophilia A or factor IX in haemophilia B. Gene therapy:  On 10 December 2011, a team of British and American investigators reported the successful treatment of haemophilia B using gene therapy. They inserted the F9 gene into an adeno-associated virus-8 vector, which has a propensity for the liver, where factor 9 is produced, and remains outside the chromosomes so as not to disrupt other genes. Immune tolerance therapy (ITT): People with moderate to severe inhibitors are usually advised to try a treatment called immune tolerance therapy (ITT).
#Symptoms - Haemophilia - 3B10.0
The severity of the condition is determined by the level of clotting factors in the blood: Mild haemophilia: Patient suffering may not have the symptoms but sometimes the condition becomes apparent after a significant wound or surgery. Moderate haemophilia: Patient with moderate haemophilia bruise easily. They may also have symptoms of internal bleeding around their joints, especially if they have a knock or a fall that affects their joints. Severe haemophilia: People with severe hemophilia can develop: Joint deformity, which may require replacement surgery, Soft tissue bleeding, which could lead to further complications, Serious internal bleeding.
