#Causes - Fluorosis - FB80.1
Fluorosis is caused by excessive intake of fluorides from multiple sources such as in food, water, air (due to gaseous industrial waste), and excessive use of toothpaste. However, drinking water is the most significant source. Moderate-level chronic exposure (above 1.5 mg/litre of water - the WHO guideline value for fluoride in water) is more common. Acute high-level exposure to fluoride is rare and usually due to accidental contamination of drinking-water or due to fires or explosions.
#Diagnosis - Fluorosis - FB80.1
All the substances containing fluoride should be avoided during diagnosis. If the symptoms are caused by fluoride, they should diminish markedly within a week and largely disappear within several weeks. Gastrointestinal symptoms settle within 15 days. Physical tests for detection of skeletal fluorosis in endemic areas. Radiographs. SA/GAG test. Estimation of Fluoride content in: Drinking water, Blood (serum), Urine. Haemoglobin estimation.
#Overview - Fluorosis - FB80.1
Fluorosis is a crippling disease resulted from deposition of fluorides in the hard and soft tissues of body. It is a public health problem caused by excess intake of fluoride through drinking water/food products/industrial pollutants over a long period. Ingestion of excess fluoride, most commonly in drinking-water affects the teeth and bones.
#Prevention - Fluorosis - FB80.1
Prevention: Fluorosis can be prevented by avoiding excessive intake of fluoride by individuals / community. Excessive fluoride intake and its adverse effects can be minimized or prevented by adapting following measures: Using alternative water resources include surface water, rainwater, and low fluoride ground water. Defluoridation of water (removing excessive fluoride from drinking water): Use of safe drinking water with safe fluoride levels is the preferred option for the prevention of fluorosis; however access to safe water in fluorosis endemic areas is limited. Better nutrition: measures to improve nutritional status (intake of calcium and vitamin C, iron,antioxidants) of affected population particulary children are an effective supplement to technical solutions.
#Riskfactor - Fluorosis - FB80.1
Several of the ready to serve foods, beverages, snacks have high content of black rock salt (CaF2) or ‘kala namak’ (which has 157ppm fluoride) and red rock salts. Tobacco or supari (aracanut) when they are chewed. Person with calcium deficiency or malnourished individuals appear to be more prone to develop dental and skeletal fluorosis. Fluoridated beverages. Diets rich in fat have been reported to increase deposition of fluoride in bones. Dental fluorosis can only occur if the fluoride exposure is during the first years of life while the teeth are forming. 
#Symptoms - Fluorosis - FB80.1
Various symptoms are: Dental fluorosis: The teeth could be chalky white and may have white, yellow, brown or black spots or streaks on the enamel surface. Skeletal fluorosis: The early symptoms of skeletal fluorosis, include stiffness and pain in the joints. Non skeletal fluorosis/ Effects of fluorosis on soft tissues /systems: Gastrointestinal symptoms: Abdominal pain, excessive saliva, nausea and vomiting are seen after acute high-level exposure to fluoride. Neurological manifestation: Nervousness and depression, tingling sensation in fingers and toes, excessive thirst and tendency to urinate. Allergic manifestation: Skin rashes, Perivascular inflammation: pinkish red or bluish red spot, round or oval shape on the skin that fade and clear up within 7-10 days. Urinary tract manifestations Urine may be much less in volume; yellow-red in colour and itching in the region may occur.
#Treatment - Fluorosis - FB80.1
There is no treatment for severe cases of skeletal fluorosis, only efforts can be made towards reducing the disability which has occurred. Dental and skeletal fluorosis is irreversible and no treatment exists, the only remedy is prevention by keeping fluoride intake with in safe limits. Dental fluorosis treatment: tooth whitening for mild fluorosis cases, composit bonding, Porcelain veneers.
