#Complication - Hand Foot And Mouth Disease - 1F05.0
Usually all patients recover within 7-10 days without any medical treatment and complications are uncommon. Dehydration may be seen in HFMD caused by coxsackieviruses; if intake of liquids is not sufficient due to painful sores in the mouth. Rarely aseptic or viral meningitis may develop with symptoms of fever, headache, stiff neck, or back pain and may require hospitalization for a few days.
#Causes - Hand Foot And Mouth Disease - 1F05.0
HFMD is caused by group of viruses called enteroviruses. There are different types of viruses in this group that include polioviruses, coxsackieviruses, echoviruses and other enteroviruses. The common viruses causing HFMD are coxsackievirus A16 resulting in mild self limiting disease with few complications and enterovirus 71 (EV71) which has been associated with serious complication and is fatal.
#Diagnosis - Hand Foot And Mouth Disease - 1F05.0
The diagnosis of HFMD is based on clinical examination. Samples for virology investigation from the throat swabs, vesicles, rectal swab/ stool or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may be collected and sent to a laboratory to test for the virus. Reverse transcription by polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is used to detect the virus in the samples. Four-fold rise in antibody titer in paired blood sample shows confirmation of the disease.
#Overview - Hand Foot And Mouth Disease - 1F05.0
Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is a communicable disease mostly affects infants and children but can also occur in adolescents and adults. It is an acute viral infection caused by a group of enteroviruses, including Coxsackievirus A16 (CA16) and Enterovirus 71 (EV71). The disease is usually mild characterized by fever, painful sores in the mouth, and a rash with blisters on hands, feet and also buttocks. Infection with EV71 can cause severe disease in children, sometimes resulting in death.
#Symptoms - Hand Foot And Mouth Disease - 1F05.0
HFMD is usually a mild disease. Symptoms may appear in 3-7 days after getting infection (this period is termed as incubation period). The first symptom is fever lasting for 24-48 hours, with poor appetite, malaise and sore throat. One or two days after fever onset, painful sores appear on the tongue, gums and inside the cheeks. A non-itchy rash develops over one to two days on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet; may appear on the buttocks and /or genitalia. Some persons with HFMD may not show any symptoms or may have only rash or only mouth ulcers. HFMD in pregnant women: No adverse outcome of pregnancy (such as abortion, stillbirth or congenital defects) is observed when pregnant women are infected with HFMD. Most newborns infected with an enterovirus have mild illness, but the risk of severe illness may be higher in newborns infected during the first two weeks of life.
#Prevention - Hand Foot And Mouth Disease - 1F05.0
There is no vaccine to protect against the viruses that cause hand, foot and mouth disease. As HFMD is contagious disease further transmission of disease can be prevented by practicing good hygienic practices: Frequent hand washing with soap and water especially before preparing food and eating, before feeding young infants, after using the toilet and after changing diapers, after touching any blister or sore; avoiding close contact (kissing, hugging, sharing utensils, etc.) with children with HFMD; covering mouth and nose when sneezing and coughing during illness; do not let children attend nurseries/kindergartens/schools or gatherings until they are well; monitoring the sick child's condition closely and seeking prompt medical care.
#Treatment - Hand Foot And Mouth Disease - 1F05.0
In most cases, HFMD is a self-limiting illness, with the majority of children recovering spontaneously with symptomatic treatment as: Ensure adequate fluid intake to prevent dehydration. Cold liquids are generally preferable. Spicy or acidic substances may cause discomfort. Fever may be treated with antipyretics. Mouthwashes or sprays that numb pain can be used to lessen mouth pain. Seek prompt medical care for children showing severe symptoms.
