#Complications - Thalassaemia - 3A50.Z
Some common complications of thalassemia are: Enlarged spleen (hypersplenism): One of the functions of the spleen (an organ found behind the stomach) is to recycle red blood cells. Hormone complications: One of the glands that regulates the hormone system (the pituitary gland) is very sensitive to the effects of iron.
#Causes - Thalassaemia - 3A50.Z
Both α and β thalassemias are often inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion, although this is not always the case. For the autosomal recessive forms of the disease, both parents must be carriers in order for a child to be affected. If both parents carry a hemoglobinopathy trait, there is a 25% risk with each pregnancy for an affected child. Genetic counseling and genetic testing is recommended for families that carry a thalassemia trait.
#Overview - Thalassaemia - 3A50.Z
It is a forms of inherited autosomal recessive blood disorder that originated in the Mediterranean region. In thalassemia, the disease is caused by the weakening and destruction of red blood cells. Hemoglobin is the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen.
#Diagnosis - Thalassaemia - 3A50.Z
A physical exam may reveal a swollen (enlarged) spleen. Thalassaemia can be diagnosed using a blood test. A blood sample will be taken and sent to a laboratory for examination. Antenatal screening: The purpose of antenatal screening (screening that is carried out during pregnancy) is to check for inherited disorders such as sickle cell anemia and to provide parents with information they need to make informed decisions.
#Treatment - Thalassaemia - 3A50.Z
Treatment for thalassemia major is a lifelong process which requires different specialists to manage the complications of the condition. Blood transfusions: The main treatment for thalassaemia involves regular blood transfusions to provide haemoglobin that the body needs. A bone marrow transplant may help to treat the disease in some patients, especially children.
#Symptoms - Thalassaemia - 3A50.Z
Symptoms of thalassemia are the same as anemia which include: Growth delay and poor feeding, Fatigue, Weakness, Shortness of breath, A yellow discoloration of the skin (jaundice).
