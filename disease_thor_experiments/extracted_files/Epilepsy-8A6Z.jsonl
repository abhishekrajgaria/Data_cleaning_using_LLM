#Diagnosis - Epilepsy - 8A6Z
Diagnostic methods: Magnetic resonance imaging scan (MRI): An MRI scan can often detect possible causes of epilepsy, such as defects in the structure of your brain or the presence of a brain tumor. For epilepsy, an epilepsy protocol MRI should be done. This test is not painful. Electroencephalograph (EEG): An EEG test measures the electrical activity of the brain through electrodes placed on the scalp. During the test, patient may be asked to breathe deeply or close the eyes, as these actions could reveal unusual brain activity associated with epilepsy. Patient might also be asked to look at a flashing light, but the test will be stopped immediately if it looks like the flashing light could trigger a seizure.This test is not painful. Your diagnosis may vary so it is advisable to consult your physician for further diagnosis.
#Causes - Epilepsy - 8A6Z
Exact cause of epilepsy is still unknown but it is thought that it results from excess neuronal firing/activity. Epilepsy is caused when there are disruptions to the normal connections between nerve cells in the brain (much like disruptions in wiring of a complex electrical circuit), when there are imbalances of natural chemicals or neurotransmitters that are important to the signaling among nerve cells, or when there are changes in the membranes of nerve cells, including proteins called ion channels, that alter their normal sensitivity.
#Symptoms - Epilepsy - 8A6Z
The main symptoms of epilepsy are repeated seizures. There are many different types of seizures, depending on the area of the brain affected. Seizures can be classified into 2 categories depending on how much of the brain is affected. There are: Partial seizures: Where only a small part of the brain is affected. Generalized seizures: Where most or all of the brain is affected. It is more common in children. Symptoms of partial seizure include: Changes in the way things look, smell, feel, taste or sound. An intense feeling that events have happened before (déjà vu). Tingling sensation, or ‘pins and needles’, in arms and legs. A sudden intense emotion, such as fear or joy. The muscles in arms, legs and face may become stiff. Experience twitching on one side of your body.
#Overview - Epilepsy - 8A6Z
As per WHO, epilepsy is a chronic disorder characterized by recurrent seizures which may vary from a brief lapse of attention or muscle jerks, to severe and prolonged convulsions. The seizures are caused by sudden, usually brief, excessive electrical discharges in a group of brain cells (neurons). In most cases, epilepsy can be successfully treated with anti-epileptic drugs. Epilepsy is a chronic non communicable disorder of the brain that affects people of all ages. WHO statistics shows that around 50 million people worldwide have epilepsy. It is very common in India especially in children.
#Treatment - Epilepsy - 8A6Z
Epilepsy is usually treated with medication prescribed by a physician; primary caregivers, neurologists, and neurosurgeons  all frequently care for people with epilepsy. Medications : The older first-line Anti-epileptic drugs include sodium valproate, carbamazepine, phenytoin and phenobarbital. Newer AEDs include lamotrigine, levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, tiagabine,  topamax, gabapentin, and vigabatrin. Side effects may occur and these medicines must be taken under supervision. Surgery : Epilepsy surgery is also done in case of focal seizures that are resistant to the treatment. Electrical stimulation : by Vagus Nerve stimulation and deep brain stimulation is done but may not result in complete seizure control. If possible another bystander can make a video of the event on a mobile phone to show to medical doctor so that the diagnosis can be made. Pulse can also be felt. If not breathing mouth to mouth respiration to be given. All PWE must maintain a seizure diary which is nothing but a simple calendar of date and year , type, time and duration of seizures. A PWE must not go near fire, heights, running machinary, dangerous occupations if the seizures are not controlled or is medicines are missed. Epilepsy is not caused by past actions or spirits and it is not contagious.  A PWE can do all activities that any other can. PWE needs the support of you and the society. NHP just provides an indicative information for better understanding of health. For any treatment purpose you should consult your physician.
