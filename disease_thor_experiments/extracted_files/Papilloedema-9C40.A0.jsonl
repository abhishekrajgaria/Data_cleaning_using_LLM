#Causes - Papilloedema - 9C40.A0
Raised intracranial pressure may be caused by: Space occupying lesions or any tumours. Increased CSF production. Obstruction in drainage of CSF. Decreased CSF resorption. For example, in venous sinus thrombosis, meningitis, cerebral trauma and subarachnoid haemorrhage. Cerebral oedema. Encephalitis. Benign/ Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (pseudotumour cerebri). Use of certain medicines like tetracyclines, nalidixic acid and steroids. Craniosynostosis (closure of skull sutures leading to decreased intracranial space). Severe or malignant systemic hypertension.
#Diagnosis - Papilloedema - 9C40.A0
Investigations: Imaging studies of the brain like Computerised axial tomography(CAT) scan and Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast. Magnetic resonance venography to exlude venous sinus thrombosis. B scan ultrasonography to exclude buried drusens. Fluorescein angiography may show dilatation of peripapillary capillaries with leakage of dye during late phase. Perimetry may show enlargement of blind spot and constriction of visual fields. Stereo colour photography helps in documentation of optic disc changes. Lumbar puncture to measure opening pressure of CSF and to tap CSF for analysis.
#Overview - Papilloedema - 9C40.A0
Papilloedema is defined as swelling of the optic nerve head (optic nerve takes visual sensations to the brain) secondary to raised intracranial pressure. It is nearly always bilateral but may have asymmetrical presentation. All other causes showing disc swelling but not associated with raised intracranial pressure are labelled as disc oedema. All patients with disc oedema should be investigated to rule out intracranial mass.
#Symptoms - Papilloedema - 9C40.A0
Papilloedema may be asymptomatic and is found on routine examination of the eyes. Most symptoms in papilloedema are due to rise in intracranial pressure. The main systemic features of raised intracranial pressure are: Headache which is characteristically most severe on awakening in the morning. It may be generalised or localised and may intensify with coughing, head movement , bending or with Valsalva manoeuvre ( forced expiration against closed mouth and nostrils). Pattern of headache may change in patients with previous chronic headache. Rarely, headache may be absent in patients with raised intracranial pressure. Nausea and projectile vomiting may be precipitated by fluctuations in intracranial pressure. Pulsatile tinnitus is ringing in the ear associated with pulse. Horizontal diplopia may be a false localising sign due to stretching of sixth intracranial nerve caused by raised intracranial pressure. Visual symptoms are usually absent but patient may have blurring of vision, constriction of visual fields and decreased colour perception. Visual acuity may be well preserved except in advanced cases.
#Treatment - Papilloedema - 9C40.A0
It depends upon the underlying pathological process. It may include: Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors and weight reduction may help in cases of benign intracranial hypertension. Corticosteroids may be helpful in inflammatory causes of raised intracranial pressure. Withdrawing medicines which causes raised intracranial pressure. Surgical removal of space occupying lesion. Lumboperitoneal or ventriculoperitoneal shunt to bypass CSF. Optic nerve sheath decompression to relieve ocular symptoms in cases of benign intracranial hypertension. Visual prognosis is usually good if the raised intracranial pressure is well controlled. If papilloedema is not managed, it may lead to blindness. Management is carried out under medical supervision.
