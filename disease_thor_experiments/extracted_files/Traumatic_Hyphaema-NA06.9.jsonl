#Complication - Traumatic Hyphaema - NA06.9
Hyphaema may produce complications such as: Increased intraocular pressure. Corneal blood staining. Formation of peripheral anterior synechia. Secondary haemorrhage. Optic atrophy.
#Causes - Traumatic Hyphaema - NA06.9
Blunt trauma is the most common cause of hyphaema. Compressive force to the eye may damage iris, ciliary body, trabecular meshwork and their associated blood vessels. Shearing forces due to injury may tear away the blood vessels. Iatrogenic hyphaema may occur during intra-operative procedures or may develop post-operatively. Hyphaema may also develop following ocular laser procedure. Spontaneous hyphaema may be secondary to neo-vascularisation, ocular neoplasms, uveitis or vascular anomalies.
#Overview - Traumatic Hyphaema - NA06.9
Traumatic Hyphaema is the accumulation of blood in the anterior chamber of eye following trauma. Trauma is the most common cause of hyphaema. Traumatic hyphaema may occur following both blunt and penetrating injuries. A ruptured iris root blood vessel generally causes bleeding. Hyphaema may affect vision by blocking the visual axis. Hyphaema may also be a sign of associated damage to intraocular tissues. Damage to intraocular tissues may be the cause of poor vision in spite of resolution of hyphaema.
#Diagnosis - Traumatic Hyphaema - NA06.9
Clinical history and examination may help in identification of most hyphaemas. Upright posture of patient at an angle of 30Â° allows the hyphaema to settle at a fluid level. Size and shape of hyphaema is recorded daily, so as to assess its resolution or secondary haemorrhage, if it occurs. Daily assessment of visual acuity and pupillary reactions help in assessment of progress of medical management. Applanation tonometry to record intraocular pressure is deferred, unless elevated intraocular pressure is suspected. Fundus examination is also postponed till the media is clear, barring few exceptions. B- Scan can be done, if retinal detachment is suspected.
#Symptoms - Traumatic Hyphaema - NA06.9
Symptoms may be: Pain in the eye. Diminution of vision. Photophobia. Drowsiness, especially in children.
#Treatment - Traumatic Hyphaema - NA06.9
Supportive therapy: Elevation of head of patient helps in settling of the hyphaema due to gravity. This may help in clearing the visual axis to improve the vision and allow fundus examination. Eye patching with metal shield protects the eye. Medical therapy: Anti-glaucoma drugs, Corticosteroids, Antifibrinolytics. Surgical therapy: Medical therapy is preferable for initial four days if rise in intraocular pressure is well controlled and there is no blood staining of cornea. Surgical evacuation of blood may be required in certain group of cases. Prognosis: Prognosis for recovery of vision is related to damage to other ocular structures, development of glaucoma, corneal blood staining, re-bleeding and optic atrophy.
