#Complication - Phlyctenular Keratoconjunctivitis - 1B12.1
Potential complications of Phlyctenular conjunctivitis may be: Corneal ring ulcer (due to necrosis of multiple phlyctens surrounding cornea). Nodular degeneration. Fibro-vascular corneal scarring. Salzmannâ€™s nodular degeneration. Corneal thinning. Corneal perforation (rare).
#Causes - Phlyctenular Keratoconjunctivitis - 1B12.1
Phlyctenular keratoconjunctivitis is an endogenous non-infectious inflammatory type IV delayed hypersensitivity (T cell-mediated) allergic reaction to an antigen. The disease is common in malnourished and debilitated children between five and twelve years of age. These children may suffer from enlarged tonsils, adenoids and cervical lymphadenopathy. Various aetiological factors which contribute to development of PKC are: Bacteria; Parasites; Fungi; Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) subtypes: A26, B35, DR8; Meibomitis; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; Staphylococcus aureus; Propionibacterium acnes; Helminth infections.
#Diagnosis - Phlyctenular Keratoconjunctivitis - 1B12.1
Clinical signs may vary slightly according to the specific causative organism. It may occur either unilaterally or bilaterally in the conjunctiva, cornea or at limbus. Phlyctenulosis begins as phlyctenular keratoconjunctivitis or phlyctenular conjunctivitis. Phlyctenulosis rarely starts as keratitis only. PKC presents as a small, round, elevated, grey or yellow, localised sub-epithelial infiltrate in the conjunctiva, limbus, or cornea, located adjacent to an area of hyperaemic blood vessels. Limbus is the most commonly affected site in PKC. Diagnosis requires examination under slit-lamp (bio-microscopy) by an eye-specialist.
#Overview - Phlyctenular Keratoconjunctivitis - 1B12.1
Phlyctenular keratoconjunctivitis (PKC), Phlyctenular conjunctivitis, Phlyctenulosis or phlyctenular eye disease (PED) is an endogenous type IV delayed hypersensitivity (T cell-mediated) allergic reaction to an antigen. It is an inflammatory condition which causes marked photophobia and mucopurulent discharge. PKC is characterised by sub-epithelial, single or multiple, gray-white, raised conjunctival or corneal nodules, generally at or near the limbus, surrounded by a zone of engorged hyperaemic vessels. The most common cause of PKC is a hypersensitivity reaction to tuberculoprotein, particularly in the developing world, where Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) remains endemic.
#Prevention - Phlyctenular Keratoconjunctivitis - 1B12.1
Measures taken to prevent Phlyctenular keratoconjunctivitis may be: Treat infected tonsils and adenoids and improve general health of the child. Patients with tubercular or staphylococcal diseases should be desensitised against the corresponding antigens.
#Symptoms - Phlyctenular Keratoconjunctivitis - 1B12.1
PKC produces symptoms like: Conjunctival redness. Itching. Watering. Discomfort. Pain. Irritation. Bleb or nodule. Photophobia. Diminution of vision.
#Treatment - Phlyctenular Keratoconjunctivitis - 1B12.1
The treatment of PKC is directed to improve general health of the child and management of local condition. Infected tonsils and adenoids should be properly treated. Attempts should be made to desensitise the patient against tubercular or staphylococcal allergens. Concurrent infections should be treated with systemic antibiotic therapy. Recurrences are frequent if general condition is not treated properly. General measures: Eyelid hygiene, Artificial tears, Diet, Tinted glasses, Warm compresses and irrigation. Medical therapy, Antibiotic therapy, Anti-tubercular therapy, Anti-parasite medicines, Anti-fungal medicines, Topical corticosteroids, Topical cyclosporine A, Prognosis.
