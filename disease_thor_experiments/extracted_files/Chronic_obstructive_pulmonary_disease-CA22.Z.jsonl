#Complication - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - CA22.Z
Complications: (a) Hypoxemia: It is low concentration of oxygen in blood. (b) Cor pulmonale: Progressive pulmonary hypertension may lead to right ventricular hypertrophy and eventually to right-side cardiac failure (cor pulmonale). (c) Exacerbations: The most common causes of an exacerbation are infection of the tracheobronchial tree and air pollution, but the cause of about one-third of severe exacerbations cannot be identified.
#Diagnosis - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - CA22.Z
Diagnosis of COPD should be considered in any patient who has symptoms of a chronic cough, sputum production, dyspnoea (difficult or labored breathing) and a history of exposure to risk factors for the disease. COPD is confirmed by a diagnostic test called "spirometry". It measures how much air a person can inhale and exhale, and how fast air can move into and out of the lungs. Because COPD develops slowly, it is frequently diagnosed in people aged 40 or older. Where spirometry is unavailable, clinical symptoms and signs, such as abnormal shortness of breath and increased forced expiratory time, can be used to help with the diagnosis. Chronic cough and sputum production often precede the development of airflow limitation by many years; although not all individuals with cough and sputum production go on to develop COPD.
#Overview - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - CA22.Z
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a term used to describe chronic lung diseases that cause limitations in lung airflow. The chronic airflow limitation characteristic of COPD is caused by a mixture of small airway disease (obstructive bronchiolitis) and parenchymal destruction (emphysema), the relative contributions of which vary from person to person. At one time, COPD was more common in men, but because of increased tobacco use among women in high-income countries and the higher risk of exposure to indoor air pollution (such as biomass fuel used for cooking and heating) in low-income countries, the disease now affects men and women almost equally.
#Prevention - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - CA22.Z
Primary prevention of COPD requires the reduction or avoidance of personal exposure to common risk factors (Tobacco smoke, occupational exposures, indoor and outdoor air pollution and irritants), to be started during pregnancy and childhood. Direct and indirect exposure to tobacco smoke should be avoided.  Those who are at high risk should avoid vigorous exercise outdoors during pollution episodes. Other sectors within a community must be actively engaged. Secondary and tertiary prevention: Secondary and tertiary prevention which involves early detection of COPD cases, smoking cessation, pulmonary rehabilitation and reduction of personal exposure to noxious particles and gases can reduce symptoms, improve quality of life, and increase physical fitness. Persons with advanced COPD should monitor public announcements of air quality and staying indoors when air quality is poor may help reduce their symptoms.
#Symptoms - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - CA22.Z
The most common symptoms of COPD are: Breathlessness or a "need for air", Abnormal sputum (a mix of saliva and mucus in the airway), Chronic cough, Daily activities, such as walking up a short flight of stairs or carrying a suitcase, can become very difficult as the condition gradually worsens. Systemic Features of COPD (extra-pulmonary effects) and co-morbidities: Cachexia: loss of fat free mass, Skeletal muscle wasting, Osteoporosis, Depression, Anemia, Increased risk of cardiovascular disease, Lung cancer, Metabolic diseases and Diabetes mellitus. Stages of COPD- according to symptoms: Mild COPD, Moderate COPD, Severe COPD, Very Severe COPD.
#Treatment - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - CA22.Z
An effective COPD management plan includes four components: (1) assess and monitor disease; (2) reduce risk factors; (3) manage stable COPD; (4) manage exacerbations. Assess and monitor disease: The diagnosis should be confirmed by spirometry. Reduce risk factors: Reductions of total personal exposure to these risk factors are important goals to prevent the onset and progression of COPD. Manage stable COPD: The overall approach to managing stable COPD should be individualized to manage symptoms and thereby improvement in the quality of life. The approach consists of health education, medications, pulmonary rehabilitation, oxygen therapy, ventilatory support, surgical treatment. (vii) Manage exacerbations: Patients experiencing COPD exacerbations with clinical signs of airway infection (e.g., increased volume and change of color of sputum, or fever) may benefit from antibiotic treatment. Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) in acute exacerbations improves blood gases and pH (a measure of acidity and alkalinity), reduces in-hospital mortality, decreases the need for invasive mechanical ventilation and intubation, and decreases the length of hospital stay.
#Riskfactor - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - CA22.Z
Risk factors for COPD: (I) Genes: COPD is a polygenic disease. The genetic risk factor that is best documented is a severe hereditary deficiency of alpha-1 antitrypsin. (II)Environmental factors: (a)Tobacco smoke: The primary cause of COPD is tobacco smoke (including second-hand or passive exposure). Cigarette smoking is most commonly encountered risk factor for COPD. (b) Indoor air pollution: Indoor air pollution is responsible for a greater fraction of COPD risk than smoking or outdoor air pollution. (c) Outdoor air pollution: Outdoor air pollution mainly from emission of pollutants from motor vehicles and industries is an important public health problem. (d) Occupational dusts and chemicals (such as vapours, irritants, and fumes). (e) Lung growth and Development-Any factor that affects lung growth during gestation and childhood has the potential for increasing an individualâ€™s risk of developing COPD. (f) Oxidative Stress (excess of oxidants and/or depletion of antioxidants are termed oxidative stress): An imbalance between oxidants and antioxidants is considered to play a role in the pathogenesis of COPD. (g) Infections: Infections (viral and bacterial) may contribute to the pathogenesis and progression of COPD. (h)Socioeconomic Status: There is evidence that the risk of developing COPD is inversely related to socioeconomic status. (i)Nutrition: The role of nutrition as an independent risk factor for the development of COPD is unclear. (j)Asthma: Asthma may be risk factor for the development of COPD, although the evidence is not conclusive.
