#Diagnosis - Gangrene - MC85
Clinical tests can be carried out to confirm the diagnosis of gangrene. These include: Blood tests: An increase or decrease in the number of white blood cells can indicate infection. Tissue culture: A small sample of fluid (or tissue) from the affected area can be tested for bacteria. This test is called a Gram stain. Blood culture: A sample of infected blood is removed and placed in a warm environment to encourage the growth of bacteria. Imaging tests: A range of imaging tests, such as X-rays, MRI scans (where radio waves are used to produce an image of the inside of your body) or a computerized tomography (CT) scan can be used to confirm the presence and spread of gangrene. Surgery: Surgical examination may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis of gas gangrene.
#Causes - Gangrene - MC85
Gangrene is caused when a body part loses its blood supply due to an injury or an underlying disease. The conditions most commonly responsible for causing gangrene are as follows:  Diabetes. Blood vessel disease such as arteriosclerosis causing hardening of the arteries, in arms or legs. Suppressed immune system (for example, from HIV or chemotherapy). Surgery. Due to infection or ischemia, such as by the bacteria Clostridium perfringens or by thrombosis (a blocked blood vessel).
#Prevention - Gangrene - MC85
There are a number of self care techniques for the patients who are at risk of developing Gangrene. The most common methods used are as follows: Avoid walking barefoot outside and wearing shoes without socks. Wash your feet daily. Avoid using hot water bottles, electric blankets, foot spas, and sitting too close to the fire. Avoid wearing sandals, flip-flops, slip-ons, shoes with a pointed toe, or heels higher than an inch.
#Overview - Gangrene - MC85
Gangrene is a condition that arises when a considerable mass of body tissue dies (necrosis) . This may occur after an injury or infection, or in people suffering from any chronic health problem affecting blood circulation. Gangrene is primarily caused due to reduced blood supply to the affected tissues that leads to cell death. Diseases like diabetes and long-term smoking increases the risk of gangrene. It can affect any part of the body but typically starts in the toes, feet, fingers and hands.
#Treatment - Gangrene - MC85
Although Gangrene can be managed by its symptomatic treatment, yet it is also necessary to diagnose and treat the underlying cause. The symptomatic treatment is as follows: Infection: Serious infections are usually treated with antibiotics. Debridement: Debridement is the surgical removal of the dead tissue that results from gangrene. Vascular surgery: Vascular surgeries can be used to restore the blood flow either by Angioplasty or Bypass surgery. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy: An alternative treatment for some forms of gangrene is hyperbaric oxygen therapy. 
#Symptoms - Gangrene - MC85
Dry gangrene which is the most common type of gangrene, usually manifests in the following form: Firstly, the affected part turns red. Then it becomes cold, pale and numb. Wet gangrene progresses much faster than dry gangrene. Its symptoms include: Swelling and redness of the affected body part, Pain which can often be severe. The symptoms of Gas gangrene are as follows: Feeling of heaviness followed by severe pain.
