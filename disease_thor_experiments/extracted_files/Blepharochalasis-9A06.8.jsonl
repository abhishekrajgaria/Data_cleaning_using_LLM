#Complication - Blepharochalasis - 9A06.8
Complications and sequelaes may be: Conjunctival oedema. Entropion. Ectropion. Conjunctival redness. Steatoblepharon (sagging of eyelid tissues due to proplapse of fat below the eyelid). Ptosis. Excessively thin skin (cigarette-paper skin).
#Causes - Blepharochalasis - 9A06.8
Blepharophimosis may be a form of chronic angioedema with localised vascular dilatation and extravasation of proteinaceous fluid. Orbital fat may have increased vascularity and dilated capillaries. Triggers: Multiple triggers may be the factors including: Immune reactions. Environmental factors. Pathogenesis: Pathogenesis is uncertain, but this condition may be immunogenic in origin. Associations: Sometimes blepharochalasis is associated with systemic illnesses such as: Amyloidosis. Dermatomyositis. Leukaemia. Pathology: Pathology typically shows loss of elastic fibers, Lymphoedema, vasculitis and epithelial atrophy. Stretching of the aponeurotic fibers of levator palpebrae superioris muscle due to recurrent low grade inflammation produces aponeurotic ptosis (drooping) of the lids.
#Overview - Blepharochalasis - 9A06.8
Blepharochalasis is a rare disorder that typically affects upper lids. It is characterised by intermittent oedema of the lids, with frequent recurrence. It produces eyelid tissue relaxation and latter atrophy. It may be unilateral in some cases. In addition to recurrent attacks of oedema, it is associated with ‘cigarette-paper’ skin and subcutaneous telangiectasia.
#Diagnosis - Blepharochalasis - 9A06.8
Diagnosis depends upon history of disease and clinical examination. There are no characteristic laboratory findings. I. History: Patient gives history of repeated episodes of painless swelling of one or both eyelids with subsequent thinning of skin, usually affecting people between the ages of 10-20 years. II. Clinical features: Patient shows clinical features such as lid or conjunctival oedema, proptosis, ptosis, telangiectasia of vessels, ectropion, entropion, skin parchment, or pseudoepicanthal folds. The skin hangs down over the upper eyelid. The disease may be separated into: A. Early phase, B. Late phase. Differential diagnosis: Angioedema, Dermatochalasis, Floppy eyelid syndrome, Idiopathic lymphoedema, Tumour, Drug induced urticaria.
#Treatment - Blepharochalasis - 9A06.8
Medical therapy: Supportive medical therapy may be provided in acute and active phase of the disease. Surgical therapy: Surgical therapy may be required in quiescent and late stages of the disease. Corrective procedures include: Repair of dehiscence of levator palpebrae superioris muscle. Eyelid tightening. Blepharoplasty. Reattachment of canthal tendon. Fat grafting for fat atrophy. Reposition of the ectopic and prolapsed lacrimal gland by re-fixation to the orbital rim. Prognosis: Proptosis indicates orbital involvement. The frequency and severity of repeated episodes tend to lessen with increasing age.
#Symptoms - Blepharochalasis - 9A06.8
Patient may present with symptoms like: Unilateral or bilateral transient painless swelling of the eyelids. Unilateral or bilateral swelling of the conjunctiva. Proptosis (bulging of the eyeball). Prolapse of lacrimal gland. Presence of pads of fat due to atrophy of the orbital septum and skin. Deep superior sulcus due to fat atrophy. Thin atrophic bronze coloured eyelid skin which resembles parchment (thin, flat and stiff) due to atrophy of fat. Multiple fine telangiectatic vessels. Blepharoptosis (drooping of eyelid) due to thinning and atrophy of aponeurosis of levator palpebrae superioris muscle. Horizontal blepharophimosis and rounding of lateral canthus due to dehiscence of lateral canthal tendon. Ectropion. Pseudoepicanthal folds.
