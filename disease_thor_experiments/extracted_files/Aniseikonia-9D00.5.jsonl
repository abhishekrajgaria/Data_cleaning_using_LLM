#Causes - Aniseikonia - 9D00.5
Aniseikonia may occur naturally or is produced secondary to correction of refractive error. Up to 7% of aniseikonia between two eyes is usually tolerated well, and it corresponds to about 3 dioptres (D) of anisometropia. The measuring unit for refractive error is dioptre (D), which is defined as the reciprocal of the focal length in meters. Causes includes: I. Optical: Inherent, Acquired. II. Anatomical or retinal: Displacement of retinal elements, Separation of neuroepithelial elements, Streching of retina, Retinal oedema. III. Central or cortical: Asymmetrical simultaneous perception by cerebral cortex.
#Diagnosis - Aniseikonia - 9D00.5
Diagnosis depends upon clinical symptoms and retinoscopic examination in patients with defective visual acuity. Clinical aniseikonia may be defined as the amount of aniseikonia that is necessary to correct to eliminate symptoms. It usually occurs when the difference in image size between two eyes approaches 0.75%. Clinical types of aniseikonia: Aniseikonia may be either symmetrical or asymmetrical. Symmetrical aniseikonia: In symmetrical aniseikonia, one image is larger than the other, either in all dimensions or in one meridian only. This difference in meridian may be oblique. Overall aniseikonia, Meridional or cylindrical aniseikonia, Compound aniseikonia. Asymmetrical aniseikonia: In asymmetrical aniseikonia, the image is distorted in some degree. This may be: Prismatic type, Pincushion type, Barrel type, Oblique type. Tests for aniseikonia: An eikonometer is an instrument used to detect and measure aniseikonia. There are two basic types of eikonometer, the direct eikonometer and the space eikonometer. Clinically, a simple printed direct comparison aniseikonia test and a computerised test is available to analyse aniseikonia.
#Overview - Aniseikonia - 9D00.5
Aniseikonia is defined as a difference in the shape and/or size of images presented to the visual cortex by two eyes. The brain is unable to fuse two images, resulting in an extra ghost image or diplopia. Aniseikonia is often produced due to significant amount of anisometropia, especially when it is corrected by spectacles instead of contact lenses.  It is difficult to detect aniseikonia based on history and clinical examination. Aniseikonia precludes fusion of images when the degree is large. Despite this, it is rare that a patient volunteer a difference in image size and/or shape between the two eyes. Aniseikonia is usually considered clinically significant when the image size difference is greater than 4 percent, but many patients experience distortions in spatial perception and/or uncomfortable binocular vision with differences as small as 2 percent.
#Symptoms - Aniseikonia - 9D00.5
Tolerance for the disease varies amongst individual patient. Some patients apparently are able to tolerate rather large aniseikonia and others suffer severe symptoms with even smaller degree. It is when difference in size of the image or meridional distortions approaches tolerance levels that the symptoms manifest. Meridional distortions are poorly tolerated, especially when they are oblique. When the variation in magnification or meridional distortion between two eyes is disproportionately high, it may produce symptoms such as Headache, Asthenopia (eye strain), Ocular discomfort or fatigue, Blurring of vision, Difficulty in reading, Photophobia, Disturbances in binocular vision, Amblyopia in children at an early stage of life, Diplopia, Disorientation, Disturbance in depth perception, Dizziness.
#Treatment - Aniseikonia - 9D00.5
Medical therapy: Principal factors which influence optical correction are aniseikonia and amblyopia. Anisometropia or difference in the refractive error of the two eyes is the most common cause of aniseikonia. Medical therapy includes: Spectacles: The corrective glasses may be tolerated up to a maximum difference of 4 D in two eyes. A difference more than 4 D produces diplopia. In children younger than 12 years of age, where best visual correction is required in both the eyes, contact lenses are preferred. In adults, best correction may be prescribed which does not result in ocular discomfort. Contact lenses: Contact lenses are advised for higher degrees of anisometropia. These are more useful in young children with high anisometropia, who may become amblyopic in more ametropic eye. Surgical therapy: This is the preferred mode of treatment. Surgical therapy includes: Intraocular lens implantation, Refractive corneal surgery, Removal of crystalline lens, Phakic IOL, Clear lens extraction with the implantation of an IOL.
