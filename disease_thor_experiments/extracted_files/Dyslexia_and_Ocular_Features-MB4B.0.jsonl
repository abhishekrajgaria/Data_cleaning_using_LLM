#Causes - Dyslexia and Ocular Features - MB4B.0
The aetiology of dyslexia is unknown. It is believed to have both genetic and neural processing deficits. Genetics: Most genetic studies have focused on genes implicated in reading ability and disability, particularly those associated with word reading and spelling difficulties. Neural: Dyslexia may have its origin in the complex neurobiological events that underlie language acquisition and processing as it pertains to writing and reading. Phonological model: Phonological model is the most widely accepted. Reading is a decoding skill while spelling and writing are encoding skills.
#Diagnosis - Dyslexia and Ocular Features - MB4B.0
The Diagnosis of dyslexia should not be made in isolation and should be by multidisciplinary team. The diagnosis requires a detailed reading assessment and phonological processing. Systemic features: Learning difficulties, especially mathematical and linguistic skills are affected most. Linguistic learning difficulties may also involve difficulties with spelling and written expression. Ophthalmological features: There are no recognised ocular features that are characteristic or specific to dyslexia. The contribution of these defects is usually minor and does not contribute to the aetiology of dyslexia.
#Symptoms - Dyslexia and Ocular Features - MB4B.0
Inaccurate, effortful, and slow reading at word level. Difficulty recognising and processing written language. Difficulty in learning.
#Overview - Dyslexia and Ocular Features - MB4B.0
Dyslexia is the commonly accepted term for difficulty in reading.  Dyslexia refers to a pattern of learning difficulties characterised by problems with accurate or fluent word recognition, poor decoding, and poor spelling abilities. Specific Learning Disorder (SLD) in reading/decoding single word is also known as dyslexia.  SLD is one of the six neuro-developmental disorders delineated in fifth edition of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-5 (DSM-5).
#Treatment - Dyslexia and Ocular Features - MB4B.0
General: Educational interventions: Appropriate educational interventions are adopted to assist affected children. The recognition of normal intelligence allows setting of appropriate educational needs. For dyslexic patients, books-on-tape or non-written information is much more effective than written material. Ocular: Any significant visual defect is treated accordingly. This may include: Prescription of glasses for significant refractive error. Treatment of phorias with symptoms of asthenopia. Treatment of significant convergence insufficiency by convergence and accommodation exercises.
