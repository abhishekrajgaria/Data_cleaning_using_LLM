#Causes - Rabies - 1C82
The rabies virus belongs to a group of viruses called lyssaviruses, which can infect mammals. The virus is present in the saliva of rabid animal.
#Prevention - Rabies - 1C82
Rabies can be prevented in both humans and animals with the vaccine. Mass dog vaccination aiming at 70% coverage in endemic areas, as mentioned in the National action plan for elimination of dog mediated rabies in India can interrupt RABV transmission at its animal source and can save human lives. In human rabies vaccination is used as post-exposure and pre-exposure prophylaxis for population at high risk of exposure. Active immunization is done by cell culture vaccines (CCVs). Post exposure prophylaxis (PEP): Post exposure prophylaxis should be considered in the following conditions: Bites by all warm blooded animals. Exposure to wild animals need PEP and should be treated as category III exposure. Rodents bites in forest area needs PEP, however exposure to domestic rodents, hare and rabbits don’t require PEP. Exposure to bats-At present exposure to bats does not warrant PEP as bat rabies has not been proven in India. Human to human transmission-people who have been exposed closely to the secretions of a patient with rabies may be given PEP as a precautionary measure. PEP is a three pronged approach. It includes: Management of animal bite wound(s): The recommended first-aid procedures include immediate thorough cleansing of the wound/s with soap and water (flushing of the wound for approximately 15 minutes) and applying an anti-septic like povidone iodine, alcohol. Administering rabies immunoglobulin (RIG) (passive immunisation): In category III exposure, rabies immunoglobulin (RIG) infiltration into the depth and around the wound is advised. Wounds that require suturing should be sutured several hours after rabies immunoglobulin (RIG) infiltration into the wound. In immunocompromised individuals RIG should be administered in both category II and III exposure. Active immunization with ant-rabies vaccines (Rabies Vaccine): Individuals with category II or III exposures should receive rabies vaccine without delay.
#Symptoms - Rabies - 1C82
The period between infection and the first flu-like symptoms is typically 2 to 12 weeks. Initially the symptoms usually include one or more of the following: Anxiety. Insomnia. Confusion. Agitation. Fever. Headache. Nausea and vomiting. This shall soon be followed by:- Inability to drink water and / or fear for water ( hydrophobia ). Fear for draught of air ( aerophobia ). Fear for light ( photophobia ). Abnormal  behaviour. Hallucinations progressing to delirium. Violent behaviour, in some. Slight or partial paralysis. Ultimately leading to cardio-respiratory failure and death. 
#Diagnosis - Rabies - 1C82
The primary diagnosis of rabies depends on clinical presentation and history of exposure to a suspect rabid animal or rabies virus(RABV). The WHO defines a human clinical case of rabies as follows: A person presenting with an acute neurological syndrome (encephalitis) dominated by forms of hyperactivity (furious rabies) or paralytic signs (paralytic rabies) progressing towards coma and death, usually by cardiac or respiratory failure, typically within 7–10 days after the first sign. Signs and symptoms of rabies include any of the following: hydrophobia, aerophobia, photophobia, paraesthesia or localized pain, dysphagia, localized weakness, nausea or vomiting. Tests used to confirm a diagnosis of rabies in its more advanced stages include: Saliva test – A sample of saliva is tested for the presence of the rabies virus. lumbar puncture – A needle is used to remove a small sample of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which can be checked for the rabies antibodies (CSF is the fluid that surrounds brain and spinal cord). Blood tests – Blood is checked for the rabies antibodies. Skin biopsy – A small sample of skin is removed and checked for the presence of the rabies virus. Fluorescent antibody testing on brain tissue, direct rapid immunohistochemistry tests, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction are some tests for rabies diagnosis.
#Overview - Rabies - 1C82
Rabies is a fatal viral infection that targets the brain and nervous system. The disease is zoonotic i.e. it can be transmitted from one species to another, such as from dogs to humans, commonly following a bite from an infected animal. For a human, rabies is almost always fatal if post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is not administered immediately following an exposure. The rabies virus infects the central nervous system, ultimately affecting the brain and resulting in death. The rabies virus travels to the brain through the peripheral nerves. The incubation period of the disease i.e. the time lag between the bite/exposure to rabies and onset of symptoms of the disease, is usually about a few days to few months in humans, depending on the site and severity of exposure, the   distance the virus must travel to reach the central nervous system and other factors. Rabies is a vaccine-preventable disease in both humans and animals. Rabies is present on all continents, except Antarctica. About 80% of human cases occur in rural areas. In India, human rabies is reported from throughout country except Andaman & Nicobar and Lakshadweep Islands. In up to 99% of cases, domestic dogs are transmitting the infection to humans.
#Treatment - Rabies - 1C82
Treatment depends upon the whether the patient has started to show any signs and symptoms. Once clinical symptoms appear, rabies is 100% fatal. Presently the treatment involves providing life-supporting services in intensive care facilities and other palliative measures. Rabies deaths occur mainly in those who cannot access timely and effective PEP. Prompt PEP following severe exposures is 100% effective in preventing rabies.
