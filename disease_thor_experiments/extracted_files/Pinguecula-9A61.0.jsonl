#Causes - Pinguecula - 9A61.0
The causes of pinguecula are not known with certainty. Pinguecula are more likely in males, welders and older individuals living in warmer climates. Pinguecula are more common than pterygium. Other causes includes: increasing age, Ultraviolet light exposure, Gaucherâ€™s disease.
#Complications - Pinguecula - 9A61.0
Potential possible complications of pinguecula are: Pinguecula can slowly enlarge to become inflamed and irritating (Pingueculitis), Restriction of extra-ocular movement, Astigmatism, Dellen, Dysplastic changes and even carcinoma can arise within the epithelium overlying a pinguecula, May progress to chronic actinic keratopathy.
#Overview - Pinguecula - 9A61.0
Pinguecula (derived from Latin word pinguis, which means fat) represents an area of bulbar conjunctival thickening adjoining limbus in the palpebral fissure area. Pinguecula are less transparent than normal conjunctiva and often have a fatty appearance. They are usually bilateral, triangular, elevated, white to yellow in colour, horizontally oriented, and are located nasally much more often than temporally. They may also present on both the nasal and temporal conjunctiva in the eyes of some patients. Pinguecula does not cross the limbus, and current information suggests that pinguecula does not progress to pterygium and that the two are distinct disorders.
#Diagnosis - Pinguecula - 9A61.0
The diagnosis is usually clinical and may require slit-lamp biomicroscopy.
#Symptoms - Pinguecula - 9A61.0
Pinguecula are associated only rarely with any symptoms other than a minimal cosmetic effect. Ocular (eye) symptoms include: Foreign body sensation, Watering, Burning, Itching, Mild pain, Redness. Pinguecula remains relatively free from congestion and becomes conspicuous when the eye is inflamed. They may become red with surface keratinisation. When inflamed, the diagnosis of pingueculitis is given.
#Prevention - Pinguecula - 9A61.0
Prevention may include avoidance of ultraviolet-light exposure and use of ultraviolet-blocking spectacles.
#Treatment - Pinguecula - 9A61.0
Management should be carried out under medical supervision. Management includes: Medical therapy: Elimination of the causal factor, Artificial tears, Topical corticosteroids, Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Surgical therapy: Simple excision, Laser photocoagulation.
