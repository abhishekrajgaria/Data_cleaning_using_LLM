#Causes - Burns - NE2Z
Common causes of burns may be classified as thermal or inhalational. Heat burns occur by: Hot liquids (scalds) - Scalds are commonly caused by hot liquids (water, oil), steam from boiling water or heated food. Young children are mostly affected by scalds. Hot solids (Contact burns): Solid objects that are hot can cause contact burns, especially in children. Flames: Burns can be due to leaking gas pipe or cylinder, accidents from kerosene pressure stove, lighting of crackers during “Diwali”, catching of fires in tents as pandal fires. Chemical burns: These are accidental burns in homes (such as from toilet cleaning agents), or as acid violence attacks (throwing of acid over somebody for seeking revenge and attempts to resolve disputes of love, land or business) and work place accidents. Electrical burns: Electrical burns are due to exposed “live” wires or short circuits. High tension wires close to homes, play areas and roads can lead to electrical burns. Inhalational burns: Inhalational burns are the result of breathing in superheated gases, steam, hot liquids or noxious products of incomplete combustion. Inhalational burns are the most common cause of death among people suffering fire-related burn.
#Diagnosis - Burns - NE2Z
A detailed history and physical examination are the initial steps in diagnosis. a. History regarding cause of burns and age should be inquired as it helps in diagnosing extent and depth of burns, such as: Flame burns are usually full thickness burns, scald burns from hot water spilling may be superficial burns while scalds from ghee, oil are likely to be deep. Chemical and electrical burns are deep. Age of patients-At extremes of age (infants and older patents) burns are deep because of thinness of skin. b. Examination: The severity of the burn is determined by burned surface area, depth of burn and other considerations. Morbidity and mortality rises with increasing burned surface area. It also rises with increasing age so that even small burns may be fatal in elderly people. Burns can be classified as minor, moderate and critical burns according to severity.
#Overview - Burns - NE2Z
Burns are a serious public health problem. A burn is defined as an injury to the skin or other organic tissue primarily caused by heat or due to radiation, radioactivity, electricity, friction or contact with chemicals. Heat burns occur when some or all of the different layers of cells in the skin are destroyed by a hot liquid (scald), a hot solid (contact burn) or a flame (flame burn). Skin injuries due to ultraviolet radiation, radioactivity, electricity or chemicals, as well as respiratory damage resulting from smoke inhalation, are also considered as burns. Burns are also a leading cause of morbidity; millions who survive suffer from lifelong disability and disfigurements with resulting emotional trauma and stigma. Burns are preventable. Increased efforts in prevention and care would lead to significant reduction in burn-related morbidity, mortality and disability.
#Prevention - Burns - NE2Z
Primary prevention: Enclose fires and limit the height of open flames in domestic environments. Cooking on floor should be avoided. Restrain playing of toddlers in kitchen/cooking area. Watch the child constantly especially around gas burners, stoves, ovens, microwaves, heaters and other appliances. Turn pot handles toward the back or center of the stove to prevent tipping. Never cook while holding a child. Carefully use electrical appliances and switch off all electrical appliances when not in use. Avoid use of unauthorized gas cylinders & kerosene stove/chulha. Use safe stoves and lamps. Avoid loose clothing while cooking. Tie up loose saree end (pallu) or stole (chunni) properly. Never hold a cup of hot liquid near infant/toddlers. Check the temperature of water before bath. Secondary Prevention: Both pre-hospital and hospital care play an important role in the management of burn patients by preventing deaths and disability. First aid, Better hospital care. Tertiary prevention: Rehabilitation.
#Symptoms - Burns - NE2Z
Symptoms of burn depend on the depth of the burn. Burns can be divided into three types. First degree or superficial burns involves the upper skin layer. They produce redness (erythema) and pain (tenderness). Blisters are absent. Second degree or partial thickness burns affect deeper skin layers. Symptoms are more severe and usually include blisters. Third degree or full thickness burns involve all skin layers. Skin is white (appears cooked), and there may be no pain in the initial stages. Due to extensive destruction of the skin layers third-degree burn wounds cannot regenerate themselves without grafting. Signs of inhalational burns: History of burns in closed space, Deep burns to face, neck, or trunk, Singed nasal hair, Carbonaceous sputum ,carbon particles in oropharynx, Change in voice with hoarseness or harsh cough.
#Riskfactor - Burns - NE2Z
Burns are more common in rural areas and urban poor of low income countries; some of the factors that are of prime concern include: use of cooking pots on ground level (floor cooking): toddlers and young children are at increased risk of scald burns as they can easily knock over the pots on the ground level; use of open wood fires; wearing of loose fitting cotton clothing (loose chunnis and pallus) can catch fire while cooking on an open fire (a risk factor for women in Asia); or due to faulty habits like use of clothing to hold cooking pot. Other risk factors are: Exposure to fire during occupation; poverty, overcrowding(single room houses with kitchen adjacent to bed/play area for children); young girls performing household work as cooking and care of small children; smoking and alcohol abuse; inadequate safety measures for liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and electricity; underlying medical conditions such as epilepsy, physical and cognitive disabilities.
#Treatment - Burns - NE2Z
A burn accident can happen at any place and at any time where medical personnel are usually not around. On site treatment (first aid: Cool, Cover, Call): The basic principles of first aid remain the same for all categories of burns with some specific management for particular category. Rescuer should take care of his/ her own safety before helping burn victim. Treatment: a. Initial treatment includes assessment and maintenance of following parameters with ABCDE approach: Airway, Breathing, Circulation, Disability, Exposure. b. In all cases, tetanus prophylaxis should be administered. c. Wound care. d. Systemic antibiotics are given to treat and prevent wound infections. e. Proper nutrition with adequate supply of energy and proteins should be given to patients. f. Specialized care may be provided during healing process in the form of skin grafts or surgical release of contractures due to scars.
