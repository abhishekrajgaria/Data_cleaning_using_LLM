#Complications - Neurotrophic Keratopathy - 1F00.10
Anaesthetic cornea due to neurotrophic keratopathy may develop complications such as: Blurred vision due to epithelial irregularity, corneal neovascularisation or corneal scarring. Secondary infections leading to bacterial keratitis. Corneal perforation following stromal melting or corneal ulceration.
#Causes - Neurotrophic Keratopathy - 1F00.10
The causes of neurotrophic keratopathy are all those conditions that decrease sensitivity of cornea. The most common are herpes infections of the cornea, surgery for trigeminal neuralgia, and surgery for acoustic neuroma. Various causes and associations of corneal anaesthesia are: Fifth cranial nerve palsy: Intracranial: Aneurysms, neoplasms, stroke. Iatrogenic: Surgery for acoustic neuroma or trigeminal neuralgia. Genetic: Familial dysautonomia (Riley-Day syndrome), Goldenhar-Gorlin syndrome, MÃ¶bius syndrome, familial corneal hypoaesthesia, or congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis. Facial trauma. Ocular: Viral infections: Herpes simplex and Herpes zoster. Toxicity: Chemical injury, toxic keratopathy due to drugs, chronic topical anaesthesia abuse. Iatrogenic: Refractive laser surgery e.g. laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK), trauma to ciliary nerves via laser or surgery, corneal incisions. Contact lens wear. Chronic ocular surface injury. Ocular inflammation. Dark colour of eyes. Increasing age. Adie syndrome. Thermal injury. Orbital neoplasia. Corneal dystrophies: Lattice, Granular.
#Overview - Neurotrophic Keratopathy - 1F00.10
Neurotrophic keratopathy (NK), Neurotrophic keratitis or Trigeminal neuropathic keratopathy is a rare degenerative corneal disease. It is characterised by lack of or decreased corneal sensation, corneal epithelial breakdown and impaired healing, resulting into increased susceptibility of the corneal surface to injury and compromised healing. In severe cases this can lead to stromal melting, corneal ulceration and even perforation.
#Diagnosis - Neurotrophic Keratopathy - 1F00.10
Diagnosis of neurotrophic keratopathy is based on the clinical history, findings and evaluation of corneal sensitivity. Testing of corneal nerve sensitivity and imaging of corneal nerves aid in the management of NK patients who cannot have corneal transplantation. Clinical history: Clinical history should include causes that can cause local injury to corneal sensory nerves (chronic topical drug or anaesthetic abuse, previous ocular trauma or surgery, chemical injury or use of contact lenses), therapies that can cause impairment of trigeminal innervations (antihistamine, antipsychotic, and neuroleptic drugs), systemic diseases such as diabetes mellitus, and congenital diseases. Brain neoplasms and vascular accidents may damage the fifth cranial nerve or its nucleus.
#Symptoms - Neurotrophic Keratopathy - 1F00.10
Patients commonly do not complain of ocular surface symptoms, since corneal sensory innervation is compromised in neurotrophic keratopathy. Therefore, patients may not seek medical advice for months or even years after the onset of the disease. Sometimes patient may complain of blurred vision due to: Irregular epithelium, Scarring, Corneal oedema or Persistent epithelial corneal defects. Corneal scarring may also lead to symptoms of ocular surface discomfort.
#Prevention - Neurotrophic Keratopathy - 1F00.10
Since there is wide range of underlying pathologies observed in neurotrophic keratopathy, there is no consistent approach possible to prevent the disease. The most important preventive approach is the prompt identification of patients with stage 1who can be addressed with intense and continuous ocular lubrication with preservative-free artificial tears. The prevention of disease progression with the use of therapeutic bandage contact lenses is also a valid approach for small persistent epithelial defects.
#Treatment - Neurotrophic Keratopathy - 1F00.10
Medical therapy: Topical artificial tears: To protect corneal epithelium and to minimise ocular surface irritation from long-term use, preservative-free topical preparations are considered for lubrication. Other topical preparations, if used for pre-existing ocular co-morbidity, may also be obtained preservative-free. Eyelid hygiene: Eyelid hygiene and treatment of blepharitis improves meibomian gland function and reduces the risk of secondary infection. Oral doxycycline: Oral doxycycline may be used to treat blepharitis and reduce tear concentrations of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). MMPs have been implicated as a contributing factor of the surface epithelium failing to heal in recurrent corneal erosion syndrome. Bandage contact lens: Bandage contact lens was previously used as a temporary measure to protect the corneal surface. Bandage contact lens may introduce infection and be a risk factor for secondary infective keratitis. Punctal plugs: Punctal plugs may be considered to block punctum, in order to increase tears on the ocular surface. Surgical therapy: Surgical correction: Any exposure of the corneal surface, secondary to either an eyelid defect or lid malposition, should be corrected by surgical means. Limbal stem cell transplantation: Limbal stem cell transplantation may be considered in patients of NK with associated co-morbid condition of LSCD to improve the prognosis.
