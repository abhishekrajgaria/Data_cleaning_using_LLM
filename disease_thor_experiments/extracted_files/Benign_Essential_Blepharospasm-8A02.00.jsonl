#Diagnosis - Benign Essential Blepharospasm - 8A02.00
Diagnosis of BEB is made clinically (based on history and physical examination) and it is a diagnosis of exclusion by ruling out the presence of associated conditions. Clinical features: Benign Essential Blepharospasm: At onset of BEB, there is increased frequency of blinking precipitated by stimuli such as wind, sunlight, noise, air pollution, reading, watching television, stress, or movement of eye or head. Patients may develop sensory tricks (‘geste antagoniste’) to relieve symptoms such as tics and movements of other muscles innervated by facial nerve e.g. whistling, coughing, eating, picking teeth, yawning or chewing gum. Eyelid spasm, a characteristic feature of blepharospasm, sets in a few months to years after early features. Blepharospasm is unilateral to begin with but usually eventually evolves into a bilateral condition. Blepharospasm usually lasts for minutes to hours together. Blepharospasm has a variable course and may be intermittent or continuous. It is slowly progressive in most of the patients.
#Causes - Benign Essential Blepharospasm - 8A02.00
Exact cause of benign essential blepharospasm is not known. Some evidence using functional neuroimaging studies, suggests dysfunction within basal ganglia. Rarely, genetics play a role in some cases. Some patients with blepharospasm have at least one first degree relative with some form of focal dystonia. Rarely, it may be inherited as an autosomal dominant condition.
#Overview - Benign Essential Blepharospasm - 8A02.00
Benign essential blepharospasm (BEB) is an idiopathic disorder of progressive involuntary spasms of orbicularis oculi and upper facial muscles leading to closure of eyelids. BEB is a bilateral condition and a form of focal dystonia (repetitive involuntary sustained muscle contraction) characterised by episodic contraction of protractor (drawing a part forward) muscles (orbicularis oculi, procerus and corrugator superciliaris) and is not associated with another disease. Severe blepharospasm may temporarily make patient functionally blind. Blepharospasm may be precipitated by factors such as reading, bright light, driving or stress and alleviated by talking, relaxation or walking.
#Symptoms - Benign Essential Blepharospasm - 8A02.00
Benign essential blepharospasm may have following symptoms:- Symptoms preceding diagnosis are:- Watering of eyes. Intolerance of light. Vague ocular pain. Early symptoms of blepharospasm are:- Increased rate of blinking. Eyelid spasms. Irritation of eyes. Midfacial or lower facial spasm. Brow spasm. Eyelid Tic (habitual spasmodic muscular contraction).
#Risk Factors - Benign Essential Blepharospasm - 8A02.00
Variable risk factors are there for blepharospasm such as:- Injury to head or face. Reflex blepharospasm may be triggered by filamentary keratitis, intraocular inflammation, severely dry eyes, blepharitis, or light sensitivity. Stress. Family history of dystonia or tremor.
#Treatment - Benign Essential Blepharospasm - 8A02.00
Management should be under medical supervision. Currently, there is no cure for BEB and the disease frequently progresses despite treatment. Medical therapy: Botulinum A toxin: Subcutaneous Botulinum A toxin injected along upper and lower eyelid and eyebrow gives temporary relief. The toxin interferes with transmitter acetylcholine release from nerve terminals and cause paralysis of injected muscle. Botulinum A toxin is derived from anaerobic, gram-positive bacteria named Clostridium botulinum. Surgical management: Surgical management of BEB is usually reserved for patients who are unresponsive or cannot tolerate to botulinum injections. Surgery can be: Myectomy: Myectomy involves removal of protractor orbicularis oculi muscle. Extended myectomy: Extended myectomy involves removal of protractor orbicularis oculi, procerus and corrugator supercilliaris muscles. Blepharospasm may be associated with the use of medications such as:- Benzodiazepines: Prolonged use or acute withdrawal of benzodiazepines. Dopaminergic drugs: Use of dopaminergic drugs e.g. in patients with Parkinson’s disease. Antihistaminics: Use of antihistaminics as in nasal decongestants. Sympathomimetic drugs.
