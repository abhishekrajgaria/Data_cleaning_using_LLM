#Causes - Dacryoadenitis - 1D80.Y
The causes of lacrimal gland inflammation may be classified as: Infectious, Idiopathic, Autoimmune, Lymphoproliferative. Infectious dacryoadenitis: It may be: Viral dacryoadenitis: Viral dacryoadenitis is more common than bacterial, particularly in children and young adults. Bacterial dacryoadenitis: Acute suppurative bacterial dacryoadenitis is less common. Fungal dacryoadenitis: It is rare and may be caused by: Histoplasmosis. Blastomycosis. Protozoal dacryoadenitis: It may rarely be caused by organisms like acanthamoeba. Idiopathic dacryoadenitis: Idiopathic is a nonspecific dacryoadenitis and is the most common histopathological diagnosis made for the lacrimal gland lesions. Autoimmune dacryoadenitis: The lacrimal gland is often affected by autoimmune disorders and may be the first or only presentation. Lymphoproliferative dacryoadenitis: Lymphoproliferative tumours may also cause orbital and lacrimal gland inflammation. 
#Symptoms - Dacryoadenitis - 1D80.Y
Symptoms at presentation depend upon whether the disease process is acute or chronic. Acute dacryoadenitis: It may present acutely with: Swelling of the lateral third of the upper lid, Pain in the lid with associated feeling of pressure in the eye, Redness of the lid, Conjunctival swelling, Conjunctival redness, Mucopurulent discharge from the eye, Swelling of the lymph nodes (submandibular), Bulging of the eyeball, Downward and inward displacement of the globe, Difficulty in eye movements. Chronic dacryoadenitis: It may show: Enlarged lacrimal gland which is mobile. Mild to severe features of dry eye.


#Overview - Dacryoadenitis - 1D80.Y
Dacryoadenitis is an inflammation of the lacrimal gland. Dacryoadenitis may be acute or chronic. Lacrimal gland is located in the superotemporal part of the orbit. It consists of two parts, palpebral lobe, which is visible on eversion of the eyelid and orbital lobe. Secretions of gland form the aqueous layer of the tear film. Dacryoadenitis may be infectious or has systemic aetiology. Lacrimal gland belongs to the lymphoid tissue system and is called mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT). It contains Immunogobulin A (IgA) plasma cells, T cell lymphocytes and few B cell lymphocytes. Dacryoadenitis often lacks the inflammatory signs and may present with enlargement only, then it has to be distinguished from the neoplasm of the gland.
#Treatment - Dacryoadenitis - 1D80.Y
Treatment of the disease should be under medical supervision. Treatment depends upon the onset of disease process and its aetiology. Acute dacryoadenitis: Viral dacryoadenitis: It is usually self-limiting and does not require any treatment. Bacterial dacryoadenitis: Broad spectrum antibiotics (such as cephalosporins) may be started with, awaiting culture report. Fungal dacryoadenitis: It may require anti-fungal agents. Protozoal dacryoadenitis: Specific antiamoebic may be prescribed. Chronic dacryoadenitis: In chronic dacryoadenitis, underlying systemic disease is treated, which is guided by lacrimal gland biopsy. Prognosis: Acute dacryoadenitis: Acute dacryoadenitis is self-limited mostly and therefore carries a good prognosis. Chronic dacryoadenitis: Prognosis depends upon the underlying disease and its treatment.
#Diagnosis - Dacryoadenitis - 1D80.Y
Diagnosis is based on the clinical presentation of the patient and the supportive tests being conducted. Patient may present with: In acute dacryoadenitis: There is usually unilateral, severe pain, associated redness with pressure sensation in superotemporal region of the eye. In chronic dacryoadenitis: Unilateral or bilateral painless enlargement of the lacrimal gland, may be present over a month, in superotemporal part of the eye. Acute dacryoadenitis: Following tests may be conducted in acute dacryoadenitis: Examination of smear of discharge from the eye, Culture and sensitivity of the discharge from the eye, Blood culture. Chronic dacryoadenitis: Chronic dacryoadenitis is usually associated with chronic systemic conditions. Test may be: Lacrimal gland biopsy.
