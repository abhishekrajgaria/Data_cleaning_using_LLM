#Causes - Myopia - 9D00.0
Myopia Caused by following: increased antero-posterior length of the eyeball, increased curvature of the cornea or lens or both, the anterior placement of crystalline lens of the eye, increase in the refractive index of crystalline lens due to nuclear sclerosis.
#Complications - Myopia - 9D00.0
Complications of myopia include: Complicated cataract: Apparently due to abnormality in metabolism of lens. Haemorrhage: It is related to degenerative changes in vitreous and retina. Retinal tears: Breaks in retina occurs which may lead to retinal detachment. Vitreous haemorrhage: It usually accompanies retinal tears. Choroidal haemorrhage may also leak into the vitreous. Choroidal haemorrhage and thrombosis: These may lead to severe visual loss and are quite common.
#Prevention - Myopia - 9D00.0
Prevention may be needed for Pathological myopia: Patients with pathological myopia may be advised to avoid marriage amongst them self to avoid similar disease in their children. There is no restraint on marriage and procreation between patients with simple myopia.
#Overview - Myopia - 9D00.0
Myopia or short-sightedness is that type of refractive error where parallel rays of light coming from infinity are focused in front of the light sensitive layer of retina with eyes in position of rest. The term ‘myopia’ was introduced due to the habit of myopic people of half closing the eyelids while looking at distant objects, so that they may have the advantages of a stenopaeic slit (a black disc punctured with a fine slit or hole). Refractive power of the eye is determined predominantly by variables like power of the cornea, power of the lens, and axial length of the eyeball. In emmetropia, these three components of refractive power combine to produce normal refraction to the eye.
#Treatment - Myopia - 9D00.0
Management should be carried out under medical supervision. Visual hygiene: This is important to avoid asthenopia. Proper posture and adequate illumination is required during close work. Optical therapy: Appropriate glasses/contact lenses may be used to provide clear retinal image. Minimum correcting power providing maximum vision is given. Spectacle correction: Spectacle correction may be given, but it produces minification of object size and distortion of peripheral image in cases with high myopia. Contact lenses: These are particularly useful in cases of high myopia. These avoid peripheral minification in size as well as peripheral distortion of image. Surgical therapy includes: Laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK), Wavefront- guided LASIK, IntraLASIK (IntraLase), EpiLASIK, Photorefractive keratectomy (PRK), Laser sub-epithelial keratomileusis (LASEK), Radial keratotomy (RK), Refractive lens exchange (RLE), Phakic intraocular lens (phakic IOL) implant.
#Symptoms - Myopia - 9D00.0
Infected People may present with: Anisometropia, Amblyopia, Congenital convergent squint, Difficulty in distant vision, Holding things very close to eyes for viewing, Poor vision for distance, Asthenopia or eyestrain, Change in psychological attitudes leading to more indoor activities, Defective vision due to high refractive error, Muscae volitantes or floating black spots due to vitreous degeneration, Night blindness in high myopia due to vitreo-retinal degeneration.
