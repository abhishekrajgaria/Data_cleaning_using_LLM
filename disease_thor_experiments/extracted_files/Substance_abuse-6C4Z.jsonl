#Complications - Substance abuse - 6C4Z
The damage caused by substance abuse depends on the type of drug abused and the duration of abuse. The following factors also influence the severity of the problems that follow drug abuse: Age: The damage is greater among adolescents as well those who are above 50 years of age. Nutrition status and living conditions: Poor quality and inadequate quantity of food, unhygienic living conditions and poor access to health care increase the problems caused by drug abuse. Health condition prior to abuse: The damage is less among individuals whose physical condition is good, as compared to individuals whose health was poor even before the onset of addiction. Genetic loading factor: A family history of a specific medical or psychiatric problem makes the individual more susceptible to the same problems in comparison to another drug abuser who is not genetically prone to the disorder.
#Overview - Substance abuse - 6C4Z
Substance abuse refers to the harmful or hazardous use of psychoactive substances, including alcohol and illicit drugs. The use of psychoactive substances causes significant health and social problems for the people who use them, and also for others in their families and communities. Substances of abuse include alcohol, opiates, cocaine, amphetamines, hallucinogens, prescription and over-the-counter drug abuse. (Psychoactive substances are substances that, when taken in or administered into one's system, affect mental processes). Psychoactive substance use poses a significant threat to the health, social and economic aspects of families, communities and nations.  Globally, the prevalence of alcohol use disorders is significantly higher than the prevalence of drug use disorders. Generally, alcohol and drug use disorders are more common among males than among females. According to the World Health Organisation Report 2002 (WHO),  8.9% of the total burden of disease  is due to use of psychoactive substances; tobacco accounted for 4.1%, alcohol 4%, and illicit drugs 0.8% of the burden of disease .There are  2 billion alcohol users, 1.3 billion smokers and 185 million drug users globally (WHO 2002). These three psychoactive substances have different disease burden on different age groups. Illicit drug use causes mortality earliest in life, alcohol also mainly (65%) before the age of 60, while 70% of the tobacco deaths occur after the age of 60.
#Diagnosis - Substance abuse - 6C4Z
In response to the overwhelming public health burden associated with psychoactive substance use worldwide, WHO experts developed the Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST). The ASSIST can be completed in about five to ten minutes and can be incorporated into the normal consultation at primary health care services. A list of substances such as tobacco products, alcohol, cannabis, cocaine, amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS), sedatives and sleeping pills (benzodiazepines), hallucinogens, inhalants, opioids, ‘other’ drugs are included in the screening test. The ASSIST obtains information from persons about lifetime use of substances, and use of substances and associated problems over the last 3 months. It can identify a range of problems associated with substance use including acute intoxication, regular use, dependent or ‘high risk’ use and injecting behaviour. The ASSIST determines a risk score for each substance. The score obtained for each substance falls into a ‘lower‘, ‘moderate’ or ‘high’ risk category which determines the most appropriate intervention for that level of use (‘no treatment’, ‘brief intervention’ or ‘referral to specialist assessment and treatment’ respectively).
#Prevention - Substance abuse - 6C4Z
WHO has recommended the prevention of substance abuse as primary prevention, early intervention, treatment, care, recovery, rehabilitation and social reintegration measures, along with measures aimed at minimizing the adverse public health and social consequences of drug abuse. Successful prevention of substance use and risk reduction is thus an essential approach to achieve better public health outcomes in following disorders: The prevention of substance-induced mental disorders and reductions in injuries and violence (traffic and domestic injuries, child abuse, and gender-based, sexual and other violence), reduction in  communicable diseases such as HIV, viral hepatitis and tuberculosis, sexual and reproductive health problems (sexually transmitted infections, unplanned pregnancies and complicated pregnancies) and reduction in noncommunicable diseases (such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases and liver diseases).
#Risk Factor - Substance abuse - 6C4Z
Risk factors- Some risk factors that can influence a child for later substance abuse and other problems have their presence during different developmental periods of life. Many risk factors are related and tend to cluster together. Following are the various risk factors: Prenatal period: Smoking and drinking alcohol during pregnancy can affect a developing fetus with altered growth and physical development and cognitive impairments in the child. Infancy and childhood: Insecure attachment during the child’s first year of life can cause a child to be aggressive or withdrawn and have difficulty interacting with other children or adults. Uncontrolled aggression during early childhood can lead to poor social skills and problems during preschool period. Lack of classroom structure in the school environment can lead to additional social and behavioral problems in children and academic failure. At the same time, they may be exposed to greater availability of drugs, drug abusers, and social activities involving drugs. These challenges can increase the risk that they will abuse alcohol, tobacco, and other substances. Parental abuse and neglect are commonly seen as part of the cause of drug abuse. An adolescent or pre-adolescent may be trying to gain attention from an inattentive parent or escape an abusive one by using drugs; prolonged attempts through drug use can be a cause of drug abuse. Parental substance use can also affect child both directly and indirectly by disturbing family environment and poor parenting. There are increased chances of child abuse and neglect in such families.
#Treatment - Substance abuse - 6C4Z
Management of substance abuse incorporates many components as it disrupts several aspects of an individual’s life. Addiction treatment must help the individual stop using drugs, maintain a drug-free lifestyle, and achieve productive functioning in the family, at work, and in society. Patients require long-term and repeated episodes of care to achieve the ultimate goal of sustained abstinence and recovery. Principles of effective treatment should be: Substance abuse is treatable. Treatment varies depending on the type of drug and the characteristics of the patients. Treatment needs to be readily available. Effective treatment must address the individual drug abuse and any associated medical, psychological, social, vocational and legal problems. Behavioral therapies including individual, family, or group counseling are the most commonly used forms of drug abuse treatment. Medications are an important element of treatment for many patients (such as alcohol, nicotine, heroin or other opioids), especially when combined with counseling and other behavioral therapies. An individual's treatment and services plan must be assessed continually and modified as necessary to ensure that it meets his or her changing needs. The appropriate duration of treatment for an individual depends on the type and degree of the patient’s problems and needs. Usually recovery from drug addiction is a long-term process and frequently requires multiple episodes of treatment. Several sub groups within the larger population of individuals affected by drug use disorders such as adolescents, women, pregnant women, people with medical and psychiatric co-morbidities, sex workers, and socially marginalized individuals, prisoners often require targeted and specialized care.
#Symptoms - Substance abuse - 6C4Z
Substance use problems can arise as a result of acute intoxication, regular use or dependence, and from the way in which substances are used. It is possible for a person to have problems from all of these. Acute intoxication can occur as a result of a single episode of drug use. Intoxication is highly dependent on the type and dose of drug and is influenced by an individual's level of tolerance and other factors. Problems may be- Ataxia, vomiting, fever and confusion. overdose and loss of consciousness. prone to accidents and injury. aggressive, unpredictable behavior and violence unintended sex and unsafe sexual practices. The term acute intoxication is most commonly used with regard to alcohol use and in everyday speech it is called as “drunkenness". Alcohol intoxication is manifested by such signs as facial flushing, slurred speech, unsteady gait, euphoria, increased activity, talkativeness, disorderly conduct, slowed reactions, impaired judgment and motor incoordination, insensibility. Regular use- A variety of different problems can occur from using the psychoactive substances regularly ranging from physical, mental and social problems: specific physical and mental health problems, tolerance (person no longer responds to the drug in the way that person initially responded), anxiety, depression, mood swings, irritability, criminal offences, relationship problems, cognitive problems relating to memory or attention, difficulties with regular job or study.
