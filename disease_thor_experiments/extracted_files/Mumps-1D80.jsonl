#Causes - Mumps - 1D80
Mumps is a viral disease caused by a virus (mumps virus) belongs to the genus Rubulavirus of the family Paramyxoviridae. It primarily affects the salivary glands. Mumps is a contagious disease. Infection spreads through saliva or mucus from the mouth, nose, or throat by an infected person through direct contact, airborne droplet infection or fomites during: coughing, sneezing, or talking, sharing items, such as cups or eating utensils, with others, and touching objects or surfaces with unwashed hands that are then touched by others.
#Complications - Mumps - 1D80
Mumps can occasionally cause complications, especially in adults. Complications include: Meningitis, Encephalitis, Orchitis, Oophoritis, Hearing loss, Pancreatitis, encephalitis.
#Diagnosis - Mumps - 1D80
Complete blood cell count (CBC): A complete blood cell count reveals a normal, decreased, or elevated white blood cell (WBC) count, with predominating lymphocytes in differential count. Serum amylase is elevated in mumps parotitis (amylase-S) and in pancreatitis (amylase-P). Serum lipase is elevated in pancreatitis. Specific immunoglobulin-Mumps infection can be confirmed by a positive mumps-specific immunoglobulin M (IgM) titer or by demonstration of a significant rise in mumps-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody titers between acute and convalescent sera specimens. Lumbar puncture: If meningitis or encephalitis is suspected, a lumbar puncture to obtain CSF (cerebrospinal fluid) for examination may be considered to clarify cause. Auditory testing is indicated to assess for development of a hearing impairment. Scrotal ultrasonography must be performed when orchitis is clinically suspected to rule out testicular torsion.
#Overview - Mumps - 1D80
Mumps is a viral infection and most often a mild disease of childhood. It affects children between five and nine years of age. However, the mumps can affect both adolescents and adults. Mumps virus is present throughout the world. It spreads by airborne droplets released when an infected person sneezes or coughs and by direct contact with an infected person. In temperate climates the disease incidence is peak in winter and spring while in hot climates the disease may occur at any time of year. Many countries experience epidemics at intervals of 2–5 years. Humans are the only known host for mumps virus. It primarily affects the salivary glands and it is sometimes called infectious parotitis. In countries where large-scale immunization against mumps has been implemented, disease incidence has dropped dramatically. Before introduction of mumps vaccine, annual incidences were ranging from 100–1000 cases/100000 population. In India outbreaks and sporadic cases are reported throughout the year and from all regions of the country. Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare Government of India, has reported about 45 outbreaks of mumps from the different parts of the country in 2016. Passive reporting of mumps cases is also done by Indian academy of pediatrics (IAP) through its web based infectious disease surveillance system (IDSurv). Mumps is a vaccine-preventable disease. 121 countries or 62% countries of the world have included mumps vaccine in their routine schedule in the form of MMR vaccine.
#Prevention - Mumps - 1D80
Vaccination is the best way to prevent mumps. Mumps vaccines (live attenuated vaccine) are available as a monovalent vaccine, a bivalent measles-mumps vaccine, or as a trivalent measles-mumps-rubella vaccine (MMR) and measles-mumps-rubella-varicella (MMRV) vaccines. Contraindications to mumps vaccine: Mumps vaccine should not be administered to individuals with advanced immune deficiency. Mumps vaccination is contraindicated during pregnancy. Allergy to vaccine components. Prevention of transmission: Patients diagnosed with mumps should stay away with others for at least 5 days from the onset of symptoms. Encourage the patient for good hand washing practices. Drinks and eating utensils of patient should not be shared by others.
#Symptoms - Mumps - 1D80
After an incubation period (the period between infection and the appearance of signs of a disease) of some two to four weeks mumps begins with non-specific symptoms such as myalgia, headache, malaise and low-grade fever. Within a day of appearance of non specific symptoms, unilateral or bilateral (one side or both side) swelling of the parotid glands (in cheek and jaw area) develops with pain and tenderness. Swelling is first visible in front of the lower part of the ear then it extends downward and forward. As swelling increases, the angle of the jawbone below the ear is not visible. Patients typically complain of worsening pain when eating or drinking acidic foods.
#Treatment - Mumps - 1D80
Conservative, supportive medical care is indicated for patients with mumps. No antiviral agent is indicated for treatment of this viral illness, as mumps is a self-limited disease. No specific therapy for mumps exists. Analgesics (acetaminophen, ibuprofen) may be used for headaches or discomfort due to parotitis. Topical application of warm or cold packs to the swollen parotid area may be used to soothe the painful area. A light diet with plenty fluid intake is encouraged. Acidic foods (such as tomato, vinegar-containing food additives) and liquids (such as orange juice) should be avoided to lessen oral pain and discomfort.
