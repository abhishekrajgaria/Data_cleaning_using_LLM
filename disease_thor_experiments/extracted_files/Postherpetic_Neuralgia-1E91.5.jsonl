#Diagnosis - Postherpetic Neuralgia - 1E91.5
The diagnosis of PHN is by clinical examination in most of the patients. Diagnosis includes: Thoracic radiculopathy in cases with thoracic PHN. Peripheral neuropathy. Intrathoracic or intra-abdominal pathology may mimic pain of PHN affecting thoracic dermatome. Intracranial pathology, diseases of Eye, and diseases of Ear, Nose and throat may mimic PHN in the distribution of trigeminal nerve.
#Overview - Postherpetic Neuralgia - 1E91.5
Post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) is defined as a chronic neuropathic pain that persists for three or more months following acute Herpes zoster (shingles) infection. Post-herpetic neuralgia subsides eventually on its own. However, it may make patients suffer for years and may leave a band of anaesthetic skin. It may lead to muscle weakness as well, if it affects major motor nerve.
#Risk factors - Postherpetic Neuralgia - 1E91.5
Risk factors for developing PHN are: Old age, Severity of acute pain of HZ, Greater rash severity, Painful prodrome preceding acute symptoms, Sensory dysfunction in dermatome during HZ, Trigeminal distribution of infection, Fever, Psychosocial stress.
#Symptoms - Postherpetic Neuralgia - 1E91.5
Symptoms of PHN are Pain: Post-herpetic neuralgia may produce multiple types of pain in patients such as: Constant aching and deep or burning pain, Paroxysmal lancinating pain, Hyperalgesia (increased sensitivity to pain), Allodynia (pain associated with non-painful stimuli). Sensory abnormalities in scarred skin: These may take the form of: Hypo-aesthesia, Allodynia and hyperaesthesia. In most of the patients, pain and sensory abnormalities resolve as the skin lesions heal over time. In some, pain may persist in spite of healing.
#Treatment - Postherpetic Neuralgia - 1E91.5
PHN is an exceptionally complex drug resistant neuropathic pain. It results from changes in central and peripheral nervous system somatosensory processing. Preventive vaccination: A live attenuated vaccine to boost immunity to VZV and reducing the risk of HZ, is recommended for adults older than 60 years of age. Medical therapy: Antiviral drugs, Anticonvulsant gabapentin, Anticonvulsant Pregabalin, Tricyclic anti-depressants (TCAs), Opioids. Topical therapy: Due to the associated side effects of systemic therapy, the focus has shifted to topical therapy. It is a convenient and pain-free self-administration by the patient. There is reduced frequency of administration, reduced systemic exposure due to limited absorption from the skin surface, and enhancement of patient compliance. Local topical therapy includes: Lidocaine, Capsaicin, Topical and intranasal analgesic pharmacotherapy, Gabapentin, Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS), Ultrasound-guided musculocutaneous peripheral nerve block. Surgical therapy: Surgical approaches such as stereotaxic trigeminal tractotomy and dorsal root entry zone (DREZ) treatment procedures have been described in the treatment of PHN.
