#Causes - Lead poisoning - NE61
Lead is a heavy metal with a bluish-grey colour. It has a low melting point, and can be combined with other metals to form alloys. It is widely used in products such as pipes; storage batteries; pigments and paints; glazes; vinyl products; weights, shot and ammunition; cable covers; and radiation shielding. Lead used for these purposes come from mined ores (primary) or from recycled scrap metal or batteries (secondary). Today, most of the lead in global commerce is secondary and is obtained from recycling lead-acid batteries. Improper recycling of used lead batteries causes environmental pollution and health damage. People can get exposure to lead mainly through inhalation and ingestion. Inhalation of lead particles generated by burning materials containing lead, for example, during smelting, recycling, stripping leaded paint, and using leaded gasoline or leaded aviation fuel; and air pollution by smoke arising from the open burning of waste and can transport lead for long distances. Ingestion of lead-contaminated dust, water (from leaded pipes), and food (from lead-glazed or lead-soldered containers), food chain.
#Diagnosis - Lead poisoning - NE61
Environmental investigation is carried out to identify potential sources of lead exposure. Laboratory investigation- Blood lead level (BLL)- Human exposure is usually assessed through the measurement of lead in blood. Haematology - Hypochromic anaemia, red blood cells with basophilic stippling, elevated protoporphyrin levels (erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) or zinc protoporphyrin (ZPP). Liver Function test shows  elevated transaminase levels (acute poisoning). Other -Hyperuricaemia, hypocalcaemia. Urine -Proteinuria, glucosuria and aminoaciduria (acute poisoning) Radiological investigation shows lead lines in the metaphyses of long bones (chronic poisoning).
#Prevention - Lead poisoning - NE61
Health tips to prevent lead exposure- Women should be counseled about effects of pica during pregnancy. Children should get a healthy diet sufficient in Iron, calcium and vitamin C and should get four to six small meals during the day. Take shoes off at the door. Lead can be brought into the living space from outside areas on shoes. Hand washing is a simple yet very effective preventive measure, especially during a young child’s crawling and hand to mouth stage. Provide (lead) safe toys and items to infants and toddlers. Child play area and toys should be cleaned regularly. If a family’s home has lead pipes, use initial water from pipes for other purposes (watering plants or flush toilets) before the first morning use.
#Overview - Lead poisoning - NE61
Lead poisoning is one of the most common diseases of toxic environmental origin and accounts for about 0.6% of the global burden of disease. Lead is a naturally occurring heavy metal found in the earth’s crust.  It is soft, malleable, and melts at a relatively low temperature. It is easily moulded and can be combined with other metals to form alloys. It is widely used in many products such as lead-acid batteries for motor vehicles, pigments, paints, solder, stained glass, lead crystal glassware, ammunition, ceramic glazes, jewellery, and toys and in some cosmetics and traditional medicines.
#Treatment - Lead poisoning - NE61
Medical interventions and treatments vary depending on the confirmed blood lead level. Simply avoiding exposure to lead might be enough to reduce low levels of lead in blood. In more severe cases chelation therapy is recommended. In this treatment a medication given by mouth / injection binds with the lead so that it's excreted in urine. (While chelating agents can bind to lead in blood, they are ineffective in removing lead from the deep bone stores). Nutritional counseling is given about intake of foods containing calcium, iron and vitamin C. (Adequate iron is required to decrease lead absorption. Foods high in calcium will help to maintain adequate calcium bone stores and lead will not get stored in bones. Vitamin C is needed for the absorption of iron. Children with empty stomach absorb more lead than children with full stomachs).
#Symptoms - Lead poisoning - NE61
Most individuals when exposed to lower levels of lead show no symptoms. When symptoms of lead poisoning appear they are non specific and cannot be differentiated. Lead can seriously affect health of children. Symptoms may be related to gastrointestinal system, central nervous system, musculoskeletal and cardiovascular system. Gastrointestinal symptoms are anorexia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, constipation, metallic taste. The combination of recurrent or intermittent abdominal pain, vomiting and constipation is commonly known as lead colic and should raise the suspicion of lead poisoning. Central nervous system-Lead affects children’s brain development resulting in reduced intelligence quotient (IQ), behavioural changes such as reduced attention span and increased antisocial behaviour, poor concentration, headache, fatigue, malaise, language and speech delay. High levels of exposure can cause ataxia, seizure, coma even death.
