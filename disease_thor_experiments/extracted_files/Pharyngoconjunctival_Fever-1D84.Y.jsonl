#Complication - Pharyngoconjunctival Fever - 1D84.Y
Potential complications of PCF are: Punctate keratitis. Sub-epithelial infiltrates. Superadded bacterial infection. Chronic infection. Corticosteroid induced protracted clinical course with prolonged corneal opacification.
#Causes - Pharyngoconjunctival Fever - 1D84.Y
Causative adenoviruses consist of a group of morphologically similar but antigenically distinct deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) viruses which share a common complement-fixing antigen. Extremely stable adenovirus is present throughout the world and cause infections of the upper respiratory tract and eye. Pharyngoconjunctival fever is caused most frequently by adenovirus serotypes 3 and 7, but serotypes 2, 4 and 14 have also been documented as aetiologic agents. Sporadic outbreaks may be caused by serotypes 1, 5, 6, 8, 11 and 19.
#Diagnosis - Pharyngoconjunctival Fever - 1D84.Y
Diagnosis generally depends upon the history of presentation and physical features of the disease. Ocular examination shows: Slit-lamp examination by an eye specialist is required for diagnosis. Epiphora. Chemosis. Subconjunctival haemorrhage. Follicular conjunctival reaction. Papillary hypertrophy. Laboratory diagnosis: Following tests may be used for diagnosis of PCF: Polymerase chain reaction assay (PCR assay), Fluorescent antibody test, Immunoperoxidase test, Complement fixation test, Giemsa cytology, Cell culture, Enzyme immune assays, AdenoPlus test.
#Overview - Pharyngoconjunctival Fever - 1D84.Y
Pharyngoconjunctival Fever (PCF) is an acute and highly infectious adenoviral disease characterised by fever, pharyngitis, acute follicular conjunctivitis and regional lymphoid hyperplasia with tender, enlarged pre-auricular lymphadenopathy. Adenoviruses are the commonest cause of acute viral infections of the conjunctiva, which may occur in epidemics or sporadically throughout the year. Adenoviral ocular infections are: Pharyngoconjunctival fever. Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis. Non-specific sporadic follicular conjunctivitis. Chronic papillary conjunctivitis.
#Symptoms - Pharyngoconjunctival Fever - 1D84.Y
Paryngoconjunctival fever is characterised by: Systemic features may be: Sudden or gradual onset of fever in the range of 100-104°F, which lasts for about 10 days. Pharyngitis may be mild or quite painful. Malaise. Myalgia. Gastro-intestinal disturbances. Ocular features may be: Conjunctival redness. Irritation of eyes. Burning sensation in eyes. Itching. Epiphora (watering from eyes). Chemosis (swelling of conjunctiva). Subconjunctival (below conjunctiva) haemorrhage. Swelling of lids. Ecchymosis (non-raised reddish or bluish discolouration) of lids. Cervical lymphadenopathy. Painful pre-auricular lymphadenopathy.
#Prevention - Pharyngoconjunctival Fever - 1D84.Y
Preventive measures include:  Patients should not touch others and not to share tissues, towels, pillows, clothing or handkerchiefs and should wash hands frequently as long as the eye is red. Eye care professionals should wash their hands thoroughly after examining any patient. As a routine, they should wash their hands before seeing all patients. Health care workers caring for immune-compromised individuals are precluded from patient contact for up to two weeks to avoid transmission of infection. Ophthalmic instruments should be properly cleaned and sterilised. A ‘red eye room’ may be created to separate out red eye patients from other patients. Other family members of the patient may be educated about the disease.
#Treatment - Pharyngoconjunctival Fever - 1D84.Y
Treatment should be carried out under medical supervision. PCF is usually a self-limiting disease and it tends to resolve spontaneously within 1-3 weeks without leaving any significant complications. There is no effective treatment for PCF. Supportive medical treatment of PCF includes: Cold compresses, Artificial tears, Topical vasoconstrictor/antihistamine, Topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs), Topical antibiotic, Cycloplegic agents, Mild topical corticosteroids, Topical immune-suppressants (e.g.Tacrolimus ointment), Ophthalmic antiseptics (e.g.Povidone-iodine). Surgical management: Excimer laser photo-therapeutic keratectomy (PTK), Membrane or pseudomembrane removal, Fornix reconstruction, Entropion repair. Prognosis: Most cases of PCF are acute, benign and self-limiting. Infection usually resolves spontaneously within 2-3 weeks. Sub-epithelial infiltrates may last for months together and may decrease vision if visual axis is involved.
