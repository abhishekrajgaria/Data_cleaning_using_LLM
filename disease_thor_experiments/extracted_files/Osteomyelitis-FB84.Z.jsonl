#Causes - Osteomyelitis - FB84.Z
It is generally caused due to bacteria especially staphylococcus aureus. It is generally seen in children and if it is seen in adults it is due to: Compromised immunity. Secondary infection with pulmonary tuberculosis.
#Diagnosis - Osteomyelitis - FB84.Z
Physical examination: To confirm a diagnosis of osteomyelitis, doctor may carry out a physical examination of affected body part to check for redness, swelling and tenderness. Blood test: Patient is also referred for a blood test. This cannot confirm osteomyelitis, but can indicate infection by number of white blood cells in the blood. Imaging tests: If osteomyelitis is suspected, further imaging testing may be conducted. They include: X-rays, Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, Computerized tomography (CT) scan, Ultrasound scan. Biopsy: If earlier testing suggests osteomyelitis, it is usually necessary to remove a small sample of bone for further testing.
#Overview - Osteomyelitis - FB84.Z
Osteomyelitis refers to a bone infection, usually caused by a bacteria. This can result in the destruction of the bone itself. It can be characterized as: Acute Osteomyelitis, Chronic Osteomyelitis. It is further classified as: Suppurative osteomyelitis, Acute suppurative osteomyelitis, Chronic suppurative osteomyelitis, Primary (no preceding phase). Secondary (follows an acute phase): Non-suppurative osteomyelitis, Diffuse sclerosing, Focal sclerosing (condensing osteitis), Proliferative periostitis (periostitis ossificans, Garré's sclerosing osteomyelitis), Osteoradionecrosis.
#Symptoms - Osteomyelitis - FB84.Z
The most common symptoms are bone pain and high fever: Acute osteomyelitis: The symptoms of acute osteomyelitis include: High temperature (fever) of 38°C (100.4°F) or above; Bone pain, which can often be severe; Swelling, redness and warmth at the site of the infection; The affected body part is tender to touch; The range of movement in the affected body part is restricted; Lymph nodes (glands) near the affected body part may be swollen. Symptoms of chronic osteomyelitis: Symptoms can flare up at any time: Bone pain, Feeling persistently tired, Pus draining from the sinus tract (a passageway that develops near the infected bone), Local swelling, Skin changes, Excessive sweating, Chills.
#Treatment - Osteomyelitis - FB84.Z
In Acute cases: Antibiotics are used as successful line of treatment. In Chronic cases: With antibiotics and surgery are used as combination therapy. Surgery may be used to remove bone, to drain pus from a wound or abscess, or to remove and replace a joint replacement if it was the cause of infection. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy: Non-surgical treatment called hyperbaric oxygen therapy may be useful in treating cases of both acute and chronic osteomyelitis that do not respond to conventional treatment.
