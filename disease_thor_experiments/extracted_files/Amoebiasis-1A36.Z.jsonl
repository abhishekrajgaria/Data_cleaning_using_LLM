#Complication - Amoebiasis - 1A36.Z
Complications of amoebic colitis include the following: Fulminant or necrotizing colitis, Toxic megacolon, Amoeboma, Recto vaginal fistula. Complications of amoebic liver abscess include the following: Intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or intrapericardial rupture, with or without secondary bacterial infection, Direct extension to pleura or pericardium, Dissemination and formation of brain abscess. Other complications due to amoebiasis include the following: Bowel perforation, Gastrointestinal bleeding, Stricture formation, Intussusception, Peritonitis,Empyema.
#Causes - Amoebiasis - 1A36.Z
Amoebiasis is caused by parasite Entamoeba histolytica. Several protozoan species in the genus Entamoeba colonize humans, but not all of them are associated with disease. Transmission occurs via: Faecal–oral route, either directly by person-to-person contact or indirectly by eating or drinking faecally contaminated food or water. Sexual transmission by oral-rectal contact is also recognized especially among male homosexuals. Vectors such as flies, cockroaches and rodents can also transmit the infection. 
#Overview - Amoebiasis - 1A36.Z
Amoebiasis is a disease caused by the parasite Entamoeba histolytica. Only about 10% to 20% of people who are infected with E. histolytica become sick from the infection. Amoebiasis is a common infection of the human gastro-intestinal tract.  Amoebiasis is more closely related to poor sanitation and socioeconomic status than to climate. In addition to being a potentially lethal disease, invasive amoebiasis has important social and economic consequences. Amoebiasis may cause clinical problems in persons with immunodeficiency, homosexuals and immigrants from certain tropical countries, and travellers.

#Diagnosis - Amoebiasis - 1A36.Z
Entamoeba histolytica must be differentiated from other intestinal protozoa. Microscopic identification of cysts and trophozoites in the stool is the common method for diagnosing E. histolytica. In addition, E. histolytica trophozoites can also be identified in aspirates or biopsy samples obtained during colonoscopy or surgery. Immunodiagnosis - Antibody Detection- a) Enzyme immunoassay (EIA) is most useful in patients with extra-intestinal disease (i.e., amoebic liver abscess) when organisms are not generally found on stool examination. b)  Indirect hemagglutination (IHA). If antibodies are not detectable in patients with an acute presentation of suspected amoebic liver abscess, a second specimen should be drawn 7-10 days later. Antigen Detection- Antigen detection may be useful as an adjunct to microscopic diagnosis in detecting parasites and to distinguish between pathogenic and nonpathogenic infections. Molecular Diagnosis- Radiography, Ultrasonography, Computed tomography (CT) and Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used for detection of liver abscess, cerebral amoebiasis.
#Symptoms - Amoebiasis - 1A36.Z
The clinical spectrum ranges from asymptomatic infection, diarrhoea and dysentery to fulminant colitis and peritonitis as well as extra-intestinal amoebiasis. Acute amoebiasis can present as diarrhoea or dysentery with frequent, small and often bloody stools. Chronic amoebiasis can present with gastrointestinal symptoms plus fatigue, weight loss and occasional fever. Extra-intestinal amoebiasis can occur if the parasite spreads to other organs, most commonly the liver where it causes amoebic liver abscess. Other organs can also be involved, including pleuropulmonary, cardiac, cerebral, renal, genitourinary, peritoneal, and cutaneous sites.
#Prevention - Amoebiasis - 1A36.Z
Amoebiasis can be prevented and controlled both by non-specific and specific measures. Non-specific measures are concerned with- Improved water supply, Sanitation, Food safety, Health education of the public as well as health personnel at all levels about sanitation and food hygiene, General social and economic development. Specific measures that should be undertaken when possible are- community surveys to monitor the local epidemiological situation with regard to amoebiasis; improvement of case management, i.e., rapid diagnosis and adequate treatment of patients with invasive amoebiasis at all levels of the health services, including the community and health centre levels; surveillance and control of situations that may encourage the further spread of amoebiasis, e.g., refugee camps, contaminated public water sources.
#Treatment - Amoebiasis - 1A36.Z
For symptomatic intestinal infection and extra intestinal disease, treatment with antiamoebic drugs should be taken with consultation of a physician. Asymptomatic patients infected with E. histolytica should also be treated with antiamoebic drugs, because they can infect others and because 4%–10% develop disease within a year if left untreated. Liver aspiration- Liver aspiration is indicated only if abscesses are large (> 12 cm), abscess rupture is imminent, medical therapy has failed, or abscesses are present in the left lobe.
