#Causes - Pterygium - 9A61.1
Cause for pterygium is not known. A genetic predisposition to development of pterygium may be apparent in certain families.
#Diagnosis - Pterygium - 9A61.1
Diagnosis of pterygium is based on typical clinical appearance. A pterygium causes fibro-vascular change on the surface of conjunctiva and cornea. It is more common for the pterygium to be present on the nasal conjunctiva and then to extend onto the surface of cornea, although it can present temporally, as well as in other locations. Clinically, pterygium can present in different fashion: Slow growing Pterygium: Pterygium present as flat, slow growing lesion with minimal proliferation and a relatively atrophic appearance. Pterygium on surgical excision has a relatively lower incidence of recurrence. Rapidly growing pterygium: Pterygium present as significantly elevated fibro-vascular, rapidly growing lesion. It is progressive and fleshy with prominent vessels. Pterygium has a more aggressive clinical course and a higher incidence of recurrence following surgical excision. Imaging studies: Corneal topography: Corneal topography may be useful in assessing the degree of irregular astigmatism being produced by advanced pterygium. External photography: External surface photography may be done for pterygium to follow its progression over the time.
#Overview - Pterygium - 9A61.1
A pterygium (plural is pterygia) is a wing like triangular sheet of fibro-vascular tissue which originates in peri-limbal conjunctiva within the palpebral fissure (opening of the eyes between the eyelids) with progressive involvement of the cornea. The lesion involves nasal side of limbus (junction between cornea and conjunctiva) more frequently as compared to temporal limbus. Rarely, it affects the temporal limbus alone.
#Risk Factor - Pterygium - 9A61.1
Increased exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light, including living in subtropical and tropical climates near equator. Environmental micro-trauma. Engaging in occupations that require outdoor activities. -       Dry and hot climates. A higher incidence in males may reflect higher rate of exposure to ultraviolet radiation. Recurrent pterygium may be related to surgical trauma than ultraviolet radiation as avoidance of UV radiation has not affected the incidence of recurrence.
#Treatment - Pterygium - 9A61.1
Management should be carried out under medical supervision. Management of pterygium involves medical and surgical therapy. Corneal extension of pterygium should be measured and followed periodically every one to two years to determine the rate of growth toward the visual axis. Patient should be observed for symptoms of significant redness, discomfort or changes in visual function. Medical therapy: Medical therapy includes: Use of UV light blocking glasses: Patients who are at risk of developing pterygium because of a positive family history or because of extended period of exposure to UV light should use UV blocking glasses. Patient should avoid direct sunlight, wear goggles or may use cap to reduce ocular exposure. Use of tear substitutes: Use of tear substitutes may be considered to minimise effect of environmental micro-trauma in those who are exposed to it. Lubricating drops and ointments may be used to alleviate symptoms of inflamed pterygium. Vasoconstrictor drugs: Inflammation of pterygium may cause irritation, foreign body sensation and tearing and these symptoms may be relieved by use of vasoconstrictor eye drops. Surgical therapy: Pterygium can be removed for cosmetic reasons, as well as for any functional abnormality of vision or any symptoms of ocular discomfort. Indications for surgical treatment of pterygium are: Encroachment upon pupillary area and blocking visual axis, thereby causing diminution of vision. Distortion of vision due to high astigmatism being induced by pterygium extending onto cornea. Recurrent inflammation. Evidence of progression like absence of Stockerâ€™s line. Restriction of ocular movement with diplopia. Cosmetic removal. Rarely, for any suspected metaplastic change in pterygium.
#Symptoms - Pterygium - 9A61.1
Patients with pterygium may be asymptomatic or may present with following symptoms in eyes: Redness. Irritation. Itching. Pain. Watering. Swelling. Elevated lesion in eye. Blurring of vision due to induced astigmatism or obscuration of visual axis. Restriction of movement with double vision.
