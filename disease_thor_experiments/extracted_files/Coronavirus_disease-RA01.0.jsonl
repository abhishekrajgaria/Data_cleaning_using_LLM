#Diagnosis - Coronavirus disease - RA01.0
Two kinds of tests are available for COVID-19 diagnosis: tests for current infection (viral tests-molecular assays) and tests for past infection (antibody tests/serology tests). Molecular assays: 2019-nCoV can be diagnosed by molecular assays in samples from upper respiratory tract collected as nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs and from lower respiratory tract by sputum (if possible for those patients with productive coughs) and or endotracheal aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage in patients with more severe respiratory diseases. Serology tests: These are blood-based tests used to identify people who have been exposed to COVID-19 virus by looking at their immune response. These tests are used for surveillance purposes to know about the prevalence of a disease in a population by identifying individuals who have developed antibodies to the virus.
#Causes - Coronavirus disease - RA01.0
COVID-19 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. A novel coronavirus is a new strain of coronavirus that has not been previously identified in humans. Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that can cause mild illness in the form of common cold to severe respiratory diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV).
#Prevention - Coronavirus disease - RA01.0
COVID-19 can be prevented by following COVID appropriate behaviour and getting vaccine. Follow COVID appropriate behavior: When COVID-19 is spreading in the community, stay safe by taking some simple precautions, such as physical distancing, wearing a mask, keeping rooms well ventilated, avoiding crowds, cleaning your hands, and coughing into a bent elbow or tissue. To make your environment safe avoid the 3Cs: spaces that are Closed, Crowded, or involve Close contact. Prefer to meet people outside asoutdoor gatherings are safer than indoor ones. Virus vaccines: These vaccines use the virus itself in a weakened or inactivated form. There are two types of virus vaccines against coronavirus, weakened virus and inactivated virus vaccines. Viral-vector vaccines: In the development of these vaccines, a virus (such as adenovirus or measles) is used as vector or carrier and is genetically engineered to produce coronavirus proteins in the body, triggering protective immunity against it. The two types of viral-vector vaccines under development are replicating viral vector (can replicate within cells) and non-replicating viral vector (cannot replicate within cells). Nucleic-acid vaccines: Nucleic acid vaccines use genetic material from a disease-causing virus or bacterium (a pathogen) to stimulate protective immunity against it. The genetic material could be DNA or RNA. Protein subunit vaccines: Protein subunit vaccines use fragments of protein from the disease-causing virus to trigger protective immunity against it.
#Overview - Coronavirus disease - RA01.0
A cluster of pneumonia of unknown etiology was reported in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China on 31 December 2019.  On 7 January, Chinese authority identified a new type of coronavirus as a cause of pneumonia outbreak, which is different from any other human coronaviruses discovered so far. The new strain is named as 2019-nCoV. Afterwards on 11February 2020, this virus is named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and disease is named as COVID-19 by World Health Organisation (WHO). To date, other six human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have been identified. Out of these, four are globally circulated in the human population and contribute to approximately one-third of common cold infections in humans. The other two viruses are Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS Coronavirus) causing severe respiratory diseases. Coronaviruses such as SARS and MERS, are zoonotic, and can be transmitted from animals (civet cats and dromedary camels, respectively) to humans.
#Symptoms - Coronavirus disease - RA01.0
Common symptoms of infection may be in the form of respiratory symptoms such as: fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. Other possible symptoms include -fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, loss of taste or smell, sore throat, runny nose, nausea or vomiting and Diarrhea.
#Risk factors - Coronavirus disease - RA01.0
The major risk factors for severe disease are: Age more than 60 years (increasing with age). Underlying non-communicable diseases (NCDs): diabetes, hypertension, cardiac disease, chronic lung disease, cerebro-vascular disease, chronic kidney disease, immune-suppression and cancer.
#Treatment - Coronavirus disease - RA01.0
People who think they may have been exposed to COVID-19 should take precautionary measures to prevent further transmission of infection and should be quarantined, and if symptoms appear they should contact their healthcare provider immediately. Patients with suspected or confirmed mild COVID-19 are advised for isolation to break the chain of transmission. They can be managed with symptomatic treatment such as antipyretics for fever and pain, adequate nutrition and appropriate rehydration. Patients with suspected or confirmed moderate COVID-19 (pneumonia) are managed at Dedicated Covid Health Centre with close monitoring for signs or symptoms of disease progression. Severe cases are managed at dedicated Covid hospitals. Isolation- Those people who are suffering from COVID-19 should stay away from others even in their homes. This is called isolation. Quarantine-Those people who might have been exposed to COVID-19 should stay away from others. This is called quarantine.
